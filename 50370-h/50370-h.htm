<p class="dropcap">Whereas the inland postage on a letter throughout
the United States is three cents, while the
ocean postage on a similar letter to Great Britain, under
a recent convention, is twelve cents, and on a letter to
France is thirty cents, being a burdensome tax, amounting
often to a prohibition of foreign correspondence, yet
letters can be carried at less cost on sea than on land;
and whereas, by increasing correspondence, and also by
bringing into the mails mailable matter often now clandestinely
conveyed, cheap ocean postage would become
self-supporting; and whereas cheap ocean postage would
tend to quicken commerce, to diffuse knowledge, to promote
the intercourse of families and friends separated
by the ocean, to multiply the bonds of peace and good-will
among men and nations, to advance the progress of
liberal ideas, and thus, while important to every citizen,
it would become the active ally of the merchant, the
emigrant, the philanthropist, and the friend of liberty:
Therefore</p>

<p><i>Be it resolved</i>, That the President of the United States
be requested to open negotiations with the European
powers, particularly with Great Britain, France, and
Germany, for the establishment of cheap ocean postage.</p>

OF PENNSYLVANIA.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The visitor to the House of
Commons, as he paces the vestibule, stops with
reverence before the marble statues of men who for two
centuries of English history filled that famous chamber.
There are twelve in all, each speaking to the memory as
he spoke in life, beginning with the learned Selden and
the patriot Hampden, with Falkland so sweet and loyal,
Somers so great as defender of constitutional liberty,
and embracing in the historic group the silver-tongued
Murray, the two Pitts, father and son, masters of eloquence,
Fox, always first in debate, and that orator
whose speeches contribute to the wealth of English
literature, Edmund Burke.</p>

<p>In the lapse of time, as our history extends, similar
monuments will illustrate the approach to our House of
Representatives, arresting the reverence of the visitor.
If our group is confined to those whose fame has been
won in the House alone, it will be small; for members
of the House are mostly birds of passage, only perching
on the way to another place. Few remain so as to become
identified with the House, or their service there is
forgotten in the blaze of service elsewhere,&mdash;as was the
case with Madison, Marshall, Clay, Webster, and Lincoln.
It is not difficult to see who will find a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
in this small company. There must be a statue of Josiah
Quincy, whose series of eloquent speeches is the
most complete of our history before Webster pleaded
for Greece,&mdash;and also a statue of Joshua R. Giddings,
whose faithful championship of Freedom throughout a
long and terrible conflict makes him one of the great
names of our country. And there must be a statue of
<span class="smcap">Thaddeus Stevens</span>, who was perhaps the most remarkable
character identified with the House, unless we except
John Quincy Adams; but the fame of the latter
is not of a Representative alone, for he was already illustrious
from various service before he entered the
House.</p>

<p>All of these hated Slavery, and labored for its overthrow.
On this account they were a mark for obloquy,
and were generally in a minority. Already compensation
has begun. As the cause they upheld so bravely
is exalted, so is their fame. By the side of their far-sighted,
far-reaching, and heroic efforts, how diminutive
is all that was done by others at the time! How vile
the spirit that raged against them!</p>

<p>Stevens was a child of New England, as were Quincy
and Adams; but, after completing his education, he
found a home in Pennsylvania, which had already given
birth to Giddings. If this great central State can claim
one of these remarkable men by adoption only, it may
claim the other by maternity. Their names are among
its best glories.</p>

<p>Two things Stevens did for his adopted State, by
which he repaid largely all her hospitality and favor.
He taught her to cherish Education for the People, and
he taught her respect for Human Rights. The latter
lesson was slower learned than the former. In the prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of life, when his faculties were in their highest vigor, he
became conspicuous for earnest effort, crowned by most
persuasive speech, whose echoes have not yet died away,
for those Common Schools, which, more even than railways,
are handmaids of civilization, besides being the
true support of republican government. His powerful
word turned the scale, and a great cause was won. This
same powerful word was given promptly and without
hesitation to that other cause, suffering then from constant
and most cruel outrage. Here he stood always like
a pillar. Suffice it to say that he was one of the earliest
of Abolitionists, accepting the name and bearing the reproach.
Not a child in Pennsylvania, conning a spelling-book
beneath the humble rafters of a village school,
who does not owe him gratitude; not a citizen, rejoicing
in that security obtained only in liberal institutions
founded on the Equal Rights of All, who is not his
debtor.</p>

<p>When he entered Congress, it was as champion. His
conclusions were already matured, and he saw his duty
plain before him. The English poet foreshadows him,
when he pictures</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5">“one in whom persuasion and belief</div>
<div class="verse">Had ripened into faith, and faith become</div>
<div class="verse">A passionate intuition.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Slavery was wrong, and he would not tolerate it. Slave-masters,
brimming with Slavery, were imperious and
lawless. From him they learned to see themselves as
others saw them. Strong in his cause and in the consciousness
of power, he did not shrink from encounter;
and when it was joined, he used not only argument and
history, but all those other weapons by which a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
cause is exposed to scorn and contempt. Nobody said
more in fewer words, or gave to language a sharper
bite. Speech was with him at times a cat-o’-nine-tails,
and woe to the victim on whom the terrible lash descended!</p>

<p>Does any one doubt the justifiableness of such debate?
Sarcasm, satire, and ridicule are not given in
vain. They have an office to perform in the economies
of life. They are faculties to be employed prudently in
support of truth and justice. A good cause is helped, if
its enemies are driven back; and it cannot be doubted
that the supporters of wrong and the procrastinators
shrank often before the weapons he wielded. Soft words
turn away wrath; but there is a time for strong words
as for soft words. Did not the Saviour seize the thongs
with which to drive the money-changers from the Temple?
Our money-changers long ago planted themselves
within our temple. Was it not right to lash them away?
Such an exercise of power in a generous cause must not
be confounded with that personality of debate which has
its origin in nothing higher than irritability, jealousy, or
spite. In this sense Thaddeus Stevens was never personal.
No personal thought or motive controlled him.
What he said was for his country and mankind.</p>

<p>As the Rebellion assumed its giant proportions, he
saw clearly that it could be smitten only through Slavery;
and when, after a bloody struggle, it was too tardily
vanquished, he saw clearly that there could be no true
peace, except by new governments built on the Equal
Rights of All. And this policy he urged with a lofty
dogmatism as beneficent as uncompromising. The Rebels
had burned his property in Pennsylvania, and there
were weaklings who attributed his conduct to smart at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
pecuniary loss. How little they understood his nature!
Injury provokes and sometimes excuses resentment.
But it was not in him to allow private grief to influence
public conduct. The losses of the iron-master were
forgotten in the duties of the statesman. He asked
nothing for himself. He did not ask his own rights,
except as the Rights of Man.</p>

<p>I know not if he could be called orator. Perhaps,
like Fox, he were better called debater. And yet I
doubt if words were ever delivered with more effect
than when, broken with years and decay, he stood before
the Senate and in the name of the House of Representatives
and of all the people of the United States
impeached Andrew Johnson, President of the United
States, of high crimes and misdemeanors in office. Who
can forget his steady, solemn utterance of this great arraignment?
The words were few, but they will sound
through the ages. The personal triumph in his position
at that moment was merged in the historic grandeur of
the scene. For a long time, against opposition of all
kinds, against misconceptions of the law, and against
apologies for transactions without apology, he had insisted
on impeachment; and now this old man, tottering
to your door, dragged the Chief Magistrate of the Republic
to judgment. It was he who did this thing; and
I should do poor justice to his life, if on this occasion I
failed to declare my gratitude for the heroic deed. His
merit is none the less because other influences prevailed
in the end. His example will remain forever.</p>

<p>In the House, which was the scene of his triumphs,
I never heard him but once; and I cannot forget the
noble eloquence of that brief speech. I was there by
accident just as he rose. He did not speak more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
ten minutes, but every sentence seemed an oration.
With unhesitating plainness he arraigned Pennsylvania
for her denial of equal rights to an oppressed race, and,
rising with the theme, declared that this State had not
a republican government.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His explicitness was the
more striking because he was a Representative of Pennsylvania.
Nobody, who has considered with any care
what constitutes a republican government, especially
since the definition supplied by our Declaration of Independence,
can doubt that he was right. His words will
live as the courageous testimony of a great character on
this important question.</p>

<p>The last earnest object of his life was the establishment
of Equal Rights throughout the whole country by
the recognition of the requirement of the Declaration of
Independence. I have before me two letters in which
he records his convictions, which are perhaps more
weighty because the result of most careful consideration,
when age had furnished experience and tempered the
judgment. “I have,” says he, “long, and with such
ability as I could command, reflected upon the subject
of the Declaration of Independence, and finally have
come to the sincere conclusion that Universal Suffrage
was one of the inalienable rights intended to be embraced
in that instrument.” It is difficult to see how
there can be hesitation on this point, when the great
title-deed expressly says that governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed. But this
is not the only instance in which he was constrained by
the habits of that profession which he practised so successfully.
A great Parliamentarian of France has said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
“The more one is a lawyer, the less he is a Senator,”&mdash;<i>Plus
on est avocat, moins on est Sénateur.</i> If Stevens
reached his conclusion slowly, it was because he had
not completely emancipated himself from that technical
reasoning which is the boast of the lawyer rather than
of the statesman. The pretension that the power to
determine the “qualifications” of voters embraced the
power to exclude for color, and that this same power to
exclude for color was included in the asserted power of
the States to make “regulations” for the elective franchise,
seems at first to have deceived him; as if it were
not insulting to reason and shocking to the moral sense
to suppose that any unalterable physical condition, such
as color of hair, eyes, or skin, could be a “qualification,”&mdash;and
as if it were not equally offensive to suppose,
that, under a power to determine “qualifications” or to
make “regulations,” a race could be disfranchised. Of
course this whole pretension is a technicality set up
against Human Rights. Nothing can be plainer than
that a technicality may be employed in favor of Human
Rights, but never against them. Stevens came to his
conclusion at last, and rested in it firmly. His final
aspiration was to see it prevail. He had seen much for
which he had striven embodied in the institutions of his
country. He had seen Slavery abolished. He had seen
the freedman of the National Capital lifted to equality
of political rights by Act of Congress; he had seen the
colored race throughout the whole land lifted to equality
of civil rights by Act of Congress. It only remained that
he should see them throughout the whole land lifted to
the same equality in political rights; and then the promises
of the Declaration of Independence would be all fulfilled.
But he was called away before this final triumph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
A great writer of Antiquity, a perpetual authority, tells
us that “the chief duty of friends is not to follow the
departed with idle lamentation, but to remember their
wishes and to execute their commands.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These are
the words of Tacitus. I venture to add that we shall
best honor him we now celebrate, if we adopt his aspiration
and strive for its fulfilment.</p>

<p>It is as Defender of Human Rights that Thaddeus
Stevens deserves homage. Here he is supreme. On
other questions he erred. On the finances his errors
were signal. But history will forget these and other
failings, as it bends with reverence before the exalted
labors by which humanity has been advanced. Already
he takes his place among illustrious names which are
the common property of mankind. I see him now, as so
often during life. His venerable form moves slowly and
with uncertain steps; but the gathered strength of years
is in his countenance, and the light of victory on his
path. Politician, calculator, timeserver, stand aside!
A hero-statesman passes to his reward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This discussion, so unexpectedly
prolonged, has already brought us to see two
things,&mdash;first, the magnitude of the interests involved,
and, secondly, the simplicity of the principle which must
determine our judgment. It is difficult to exaggerate
the amount of claims which will be let loose to feed on
the country, if you recognize that now before us; nor
can I imagine anything more authoritative than the
principle which bars all these claims, except so far as
Congress in its bounty chooses to recognize them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By the Report of the Committee on Claims<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> it appears
that the house of Miss Sue Murphey, of Decatur,
Alabama, was destroyed, so that not a vestige remained,
by order of the commander at that place, on the 19th
March, 1864, under instructions from General Sherman
to make it a military post. It is also stated that Miss
Murphey was loyal. These are the important facts.
Assuming the loyalty of the petitioner, which I have
been led to doubt, the simple question is, whether the
Nation is bound to indemnify a citizen, domiciled in a
Rebel State, for property in that State, taken for the
building of a fort by the United States against the
Rebels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Here it is proper to observe three things,&mdash;one concerning
the petitioner, and two concerning the property
taken: first, that the petitioner was domiciled in a
Rebel State, or, to use more technical language, in a State
declared by public proclamation to be in rebellion; secondly,
that the property was situated within the Rebel
State; and, thirdly, that the property was taken under
the necessities of war, and for the national defence. On
these three several points there can be no question.
They are facts which have not been denied in this debate.
Thus far I confine myself to a statement of facts,
in order to prepare the way for the consideration of the
legal consequences.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind these facts, several difficulties which
have been presented during this debate disappear. For
instance, a question was put by a learned Senator [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Davis</span>, of Kentucky] as to the validity of an imagined
seizure of the property of the eminent Judge Wayne,
situated in the District of Columbia. But it is obvious
that the facts in the imagined case of the eminent judge
are different from those in the actual case before us.
Judge Wayne, unlike the petitioner, was domiciled in a
loyal part of the country; and his property, unlike that
of the petitioner, was situated in a loyal part of the
country. This difference between the two cases serves
to illustrate the position of the petitioner. Because property
situated in the District of Columbia and belonging
to a loyal judge domiciled here could not be taken, it by
no means follows that property situated in a Rebel State
and belonging to a person domiciled there can enjoy the
same immunity.</p>

<p>Behind the fact of domicile, and the fact that the
property was situated in a Rebel State, is that other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
fact, equally incontrovertible, that it was taken in the
exigencies of war. The military order under which
the taking occurred declares that “the necessities of the
Army require the use of every building in Decatur,”&mdash;not
merely the building in question, but every building;
and the Report of the Committee says that “General
Sherman had previously issued an order to fortify Decatur
for a military post.” I might quote more to illustrate
this point; but I quote enough. It is plain
and indisputable that the taking was under an exigency
of war. To deny this is to assail the military
order under which it was done, and also the Report of
the Committee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three men once governed the mighty Roman world.
Three facts govern the present case, with the power of a
triumvirate,&mdash;the domicile of the petitioner, the situation
of the property, and the exigency of war. If I
dwell on these three facts, it is because I am unwilling
that either should drop out of sight; each is important.
Together they present a case which it is easy to decide,
however painful the conclusion. And this brings me to
the principle which I said at the beginning was so simple.
Indeed, let the facts be admitted, and it is difficult
to see how there can be any question in the present case.
But the facts, as I have stated them, are indubitable.</p>

<p>On these facts two questions arise: first, as to the
rule of International Law applicable to property of persons
domiciled in an enemy country; and, secondly, as
to the applicability of this rule to the present case. Of
the rule there can be no question; its applicability is
sustained by reason, and also by authority from which
there can be no appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>In stating and enforcing the rule I might array writers,
precedents, and courts; but I content myself with
a paragraph from a writer who in expounding the Laws
of War is perhaps the highest authority. I refer to the
Dutch publicist of the last century, Bynkershoek, whose
work is always quoted in the final resort on these questions.
This great writer expresses himself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Could it be doubted whether under the name of enemies
may be understood also our friends who having been conquered
are with the enemy, their city perhaps being occupied
by him?… I should think that they also were to be so
understood, certainly as regards goods which they have under
the government of the enemy.… I know upon what
ground others say the contrary,&mdash;namely, that our friends,
although they are with the enemy, have no spirit of hostility
to us; for that it is not of their free will that they are
there, and that it is only from the <i>animus</i> that the case is to
be judged. But the case does not depend upon the <i>animus</i>
alone; because neither are all the rest of our enemy’s subjects,
at any rate very few of them, carried away by a spirit
of hostility to us; but it depends upon the right by which
those goods are with the enemy, and upon the advantage
which they afford him for our destruction.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing could be stronger in determining the liability
from domicile. Its sweeping extent, under the exigency
of war, is proclaimed by this same writer in words of
peculiar weight:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since it is the condition of war that enemies are despoiled
and proscribed as to every right, it stands to reason that everything
found with the enemy changes its owner and goes
to the Treasury.… If we follow the mere Law of War,
even <i>immovable</i> property may be sold and its price turned
into the Treasury, as in the case of movable property.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is an austere statement; but it was adopted by
Mr. Jefferson as a fundamental principle in his elaborate
letter to the British Minister, vindicating the confiscation
of the property of Loyalists during the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
It was the corner-stone of his argument, as it has
since been the corner-stone of judicial decisions. To
cite texts and precedents in its support is superfluous.
It must be accepted as the rule of International Law.</p>

<p>The rule, as succinctly expressed, is simply this,&mdash;that
the property of persons domiciled in an enemy
country is liable to seizure and capture without regard
to the alleged friendly or loyal character of the owner.</p>

<p>Unquestionably there are limitations imposed by humanity
which must not be transcended. A country
must not be wasted, or buildings destroyed, unless under
some commanding necessity. This great power must
not be wantonly employed. Men must not become barbarians.
But, if, in the pursuit of the enemy, or for
purposes of defence, property must be destroyed, then
by International Law it can be done. This is the rule.
Vattel, while pleading justly and with persuasive examples
for the preservation of works of art, such as temples,
tombs, and structures of remarkable beauty, admits
that even these may be sacrificed:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If for the operations of war, to advance the works in a
siege, it is necessary to destroy edifices of this nature, one has
undoubtedly the right to do so. The sovereign of the country,
or his general, destroys them indeed himself, when the
necessities or the maxims of war invite thereto. The governor
of a besieged city burns its suburbs, to prevent the besiegers
from obtaining a lodgment therein. Nobody thinks
of blaming him who lays waste gardens, vineyards, orchards,
in order to pitch his tent and intrench himself there.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This same rule is recognized by Manning, in his polished
and humane work, less frequently quoted, but entitled
always to great respect. This interesting writer
expresses himself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is clearly a belligerent’s right to destroy the enemy’s
property <i>as far as necessary in making fortifications</i>.…
Destruction of the enemy’s property is justifiable as far as indispensable
for the purposes of warfare, but no further.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With the limitations which I have tried to exhibit,
the rule is beyond question in the relations between
nations. Do you call it harsh? Undoubtedly it is so.
It is war, which from beginning to end is terrible harshness.
Without the incidents sanctioned by this rule war
would be changed, so that it would be no longer war. It
was such individual calamities that Shakespeare had in
mind, when he spoke of “the purple testament of bleeding
war”; and it was such which entered into the vision
of that other poet, when, in words of remarkable beauty,
he pictured, by way of contrast, the blessings of peace:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>It only remains now to show that this rule of International
Law is applicable to the present case. Of
course, our late war was not between two nations; therefore
it was not strictly international. But it was between
the National Government, on one side, and a
Rebellion which had become “territorial” in character,
with such form and body as to have belligerent rights
on land. Mark the distinction, if you please; for I have
always insisted, and still insist, that complete belligerency
on land does not imply belligerency on the ocean.
As there is a dominion of the land, so there is a dominion
of the ocean; and as there is a belligerency of the
land, so there is also a belligerency of the ocean. Therefore,
while denying to our Rebels belligerent rights on
the ocean, I have no hesitation with regard to them on
the land. But just in proportion as these are admitted,
is the rule of International Law made applicable to the
present case.</p>

<p>Against our Rebels the Nation had two sources of
power and two arsenals of rights,&mdash;one of these being
the powers and rights of sovereignty, and the other the
powers and rights of war,&mdash;the former being determined
by the Constitution, the latter by International Law.
The Nation might pursue a Rebel as traitor or as belligerent;
but whether traitor or belligerent, he was
always an enemy. Pursuing him in the courts as
traitor, he was justly entitled to all the delays and safeguards
of the Constitution; but it was otherwise, if he
was treated as belligerent. Pursuing him in battle,
driving him from point to point, dislodging him from
fortresses, expelling him from towns, pushing him back
from our advancing line, and then building fortifications
against him,&mdash;all this was war; and it was none the less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
war because the enemy was unhappily our own countryman.
A new law supplied the rule for our conduct,&mdash;not
the Constitution, with its manifold provisions dear
to the lover of Liberty, including the solemn requirement
that nobody shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law,” and then again that other
requirement, that “private property shall not be taken
for public use without just compensation.” All these
were silent while International Law prevailed. The
Rebellion had grown until it became a war; and as this
war was among countrymen, it was a civil war. But
the rule of conduct in a civil war is to be found in the
Law of Nations.</p>

<p>I do not stop to quote the familiar views of publicists,
especially of Vattel, to the effect that in a civil war the
two parties are to be treated as “two different nations.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Suffice it to say, that such is the judgment of all the
authorities on International Law. But I come directly
to the decisions of our Supreme Court, which recognize
the rule of International Law as applicable to our civil
war.</p>

<p>In the famous cases known as the <i>Prize Cases</i>, the
Court expressly says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All persons residing within this territory, whose property
may be used to increase the revenues of the hostile power,
are in this contest liable to be treated as enemies, though not
foreigners.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is the rule of International Law applied directly
to our civil war. In a later case the rule is applied
with added emphasis and particularity:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We must be governed by the principle of public law, so
often announced from this bench as applicable alike to civil
and international wars, that <i>all the people of each State or
district in insurrection against the United States must be regarded
as enemies</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, according to our highest tribunal, the rule in
civil war and international war is the same. By another
decision of the Court, this same rule continues in force
until the character of public enemy is removed by competent
authority. On this point the Court declares itself
as follows, in the Alexander cotton case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All the people of each State or district in insurrection
against the United States must be regarded as enemies, until,
by the action of the Legislature and the Executive, or otherwise,
that relation is thoroughly and permanently changed.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the present case is to be settled by authority, this
is enough. Here is the Supreme Court solemnly recognizing
the rule of International Law, even to the extent
of embracing under its penalties <i>all the people</i> of the
hostile community, without regard to their sentiments
of loyalty. This is decisive. You cannot decree the
national liability in the present case without reversing
these decisions. You must declare that the rule of
International Law is not applicable to our civil war.
There is no ground for exception. You must reject
the rule absolutely.</p>

<p>Do you say that its application is harsh? Of course
it is. But again I say, this is war; or rather, it is rebellion
which has assumed the front of war. I do not make
the rule. I have nothing to do with it. I take it as
I find it, affirmed by great authorities of International<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Law, and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of the United
States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I might stop; for the conclusion stands on reason
and authority, each unanswerable; but I proceed
further in order to relieve the case of all ambiguity. Of
course instances may be adduced where compensation
has been made to sufferers from an army, but no case
like the present. If we glance at these instances, we
shall see the wide difference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. The first instance is where property is taken by
the Nation, or its representative, <i>within its own established
jurisdiction</i>. Of course this is unlike that now
before us. To cite it is only to perplex and mystify, not
to instruct. Thus, a Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Willey</span>, of West Virginia]
has adduced well-known words from Vattel on
the question, “Whether subjects should be indemnified
for damages sustained in war,” “as when a field, a house,
or a garden, belonging to a private person, is taken for
the purpose of erecting on the spot a town-rampart, or
any other piece of fortification.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But this authority is
not applicable to the present case, where the claimant is
not what Vattel calls a “subject,” and the property was
not within the established jurisdiction of the nation. It
applies only to such cases as occurred during the War of
1812, where property was taken on the Canadian frontier
or at New Orleans for the erection of a fortress,&mdash;or
such a case as that which formed one of the military
glories of the Count Rochambeau, when at the head of
the French forces in our country. The story is little
known, and therefore I adduce it now, as I find it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Memoirs of Ségur, one of the brilliant officers who
accompanied the expedition.</p>

<p>The French squadrons were quitting their camp at
Crompond, near the North River, in New York, on their
way to embark for France. Their commander, fresh
from the victory of Yorktown, was at the head of the
columns, when a simple citizen approached, and, tapping
him slightly on the shoulder, said: “In the name
of the law you are my prisoner.” The glittering staff by
which Count Rochambeau was surrounded broke forth
with indignation, but the General-in-Chief restrained
their impatience, and, smiling, said to the American
citizen: “Take me away with you, if you can.” “No,”
replied the simple representative of the law, “I have
done my duty, and your Excellency may proceed on
your march, if you wish to set justice at defiance. Some
of your soldiers have cut down several trees, and burnt
them to make their fires. The owner of them claims
an indemnity, and has obtained a warrant against you,
which I have come to execute.” The Count, on hearing
this explanation, which was translated by one of his
staff, gave bail, and at once directed the settlement of
the claim on equitable grounds. The American withdrew,
and the French squadrons, which had been arrested
by a simple constable, proceeded on their march.
This interesting story, so honorable to our country and
to the French commander, is disfigured by the end,
showing extortion on the part of the claimant. A judgment
by arbitration fixed the damages at four hundred
dollars, being less than the commander had at once offered,
while the claimant demanded no less than three
thousand dollars.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterward, in the National Assembly of France, when
that great country began to throb with republican life,
this instance of submission to law was mentioned with
pride.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But though it cannot lose its place in history, it
cannot furnish a precedent of International Law. Besides
being without any exigency of defence, the trespass
was within our own jurisdiction, in which respect
it differed precisely from the case on which we are to
vote. I adduce it now because it serves to illustrate
vividly the line of law.</p>

<p>2. Another instance, which I mention in order to put
it aside, is <i>where an army in a hostile country has carefully
paid for all its supplies</i>. Such conduct is exceptional.
The general rule was expressed by Mr. Marcy, during
our war with Mexico, when he said that “an invading
army has the unquestionable right to draw its supplies
from the enemy without paying for them, and to require
contributions for its support,” that “the enemy may be
made to feel the weight of the war.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But General
Halleck, after quoting these words, says that “the resort
to forced contributions for the support of our armies
in a country like Mexico, under the particular circumstances
of the war, would have been at least impolitic,
if not unjust; and the American generals very properly
declined to adopt, except to a very limited extent, the
mode indicated.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> According to this learned authority,
it was a question of policy rather than of law.</p>

<p>The most remarkable instance of forbearance, under
this head, was that of the Duke of Wellington, as he
entered France with his victorious troops, fresh from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
fields of Spain. He was peremptory that nothing should
be taken without compensation. His order on this occasion
will be found at length in Colonel Gurwood’s collection
of his “Dispatches.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> His habit was to give
receipts for supplies, and ready money was paid in the
camp. The British historian dwells with pride on the
conduct of the commander, and records the astonishment
with which it was regarded by both soldiers and
peasantry, who found it so utterly at variance with the
system by which the Spaniards had suffered and the
French had profited during the Peninsular campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The conduct of the Duke of Wellington cannot be too
highly prized. It was more than a victory. I have
always regarded it as the <i>high-water mark</i> of civilized
war, so far as war can be civilized. But I am obliged to
add, on this occasion, that it was politic also. In thus
softening the rigors of war, he smoothed the way for his
conquering army. In a dispatch to one of his generals,
written in the spirit of the order, he says, in very expressive
language: “If we were five times stronger than
we are, we could not venture to enter France, if we cannot
prevent our soldiers from plundering.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was in
a refined policy that this important order had its origin.
Regarding it as a generous example for other commanders,
and offering to it my homage, I must confess, that,
as a precedent, it is entirely inapplicable to the present
case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Putting aside these two several classes of cases, we
are brought back to the original principle, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
can be no legal claim to damages for property situated
in an enemy country, and belonging to a person domiciled
there, when taken for the exigencies of war.</p>

<p>If the conclusion were doubtful, I should deem it my
duty to exhibit at length the costly consequences from
an allowance of this claim. The small sum which you
vote will be a precedent for millions. If you pay Miss
Sue Murphey, you must pay claimants whose name will
be Legion. Of course, if justice requires, let it be done,
even though the Treasury fail. But the mere possibility
of such liabilities is a reason for caution on our part.
We must consider the present case as if on its face it
involved not merely a few thousands, but many millions.
Pay it, and the country will not be bankrupt,
but it will have an infinite draft upon its resources. If
the occasion were not too grave for a jest, I would say
of it as Mercutio said of his wound: “No, ’tis not so
deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door; but ’tis
enough.”</p>

<p>If you would have a practical idea of the extent of
these claims, be taught by the history of the British
Loyalists, who at the close of our Revolution appealed
to Parliament for compensation on account of their
losses. The whole number of these claims was five
thousand and seventy-two. The whole amount claimed
was £8,026,045, or about thirty-eight million dollars,
of which the commissioners allowed less than half.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Our claimants would be much more numerous, and the
amount claimed vaster.</p>

<p>We may also learn from England something of the
spirit in which such claimants should be treated. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
while providing for them, Parliament refused to recognize
any legal title on their part. What it did was in
compassion, generosity, and bounty,&mdash;not in satisfaction
of a debt. Mr. Pitt, in presenting the plan which
was adopted, expressly denied any right on grounds of
“strict justice.” Here are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The American Loyalists, in his opinion, could not call
upon the House to make compensation for their losses as a
matter of strict justice; but they most undoubtedly had
strong claims on their generosity and compassion. In the
mode, therefore, that he should propose for finally adjusting
their claims, he had laid down a principle with a view to
mark this distinction.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the same spirit Mr. Burke said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such a mode of compensating the claims of the Loyalists
would do the country the highest credit. It was a new and
a noble instance of national bounty and generosity.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Fox, who was full of ardent sympathies, declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They were entitled to a compensation, <i>but by no means to
a full compensation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Mr. Pitt, at another stage of the debate, thus
denied their claim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They certainly had <i>no sort of claim</i> to a repayment of all
they had lost.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So far as this instance is an example to us, it is only
an incentive to a kindly policy, which, after prudent inquiry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and full knowledge of the extent of these claims,
shall make such reasonable allowance as humanity and
patriotism may require. There must be an inquiry not
only into this individual case, but into all possible cases
that may spring into being, so that, when we act, it may
be on the whole subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the beginning of our national life Congress has
been called to deal with claims for losses by war.
Though new in form, the present case belongs to a
long list, whose beginning is hidden in Revolutionary
history. The folio volume of State Papers, now before
me, entitled “Claims,” attests the number and variety.
Even amid the struggles of the war, as early as 1779,
the Rev. Dr. Witherspoon was allowed $19,040 for repairs
of the college at Princeton damaged by the troops.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
There was afterward a similar allowance to the academy
at Wilmington, in Delaware, and also to the college in
Rhode Island. These latter were recommended by Mr.
Hamilton, while Secretary of the Treasury, as “affecting
the interests of literature.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> On this account they were
treated as exceptional. It will also be observed that
they concerned claimants within our own jurisdiction.
But on a claim for compensation for a house burnt at
Charlestown for the purpose of dislodging the enemy, by
order of the American commander at that point during
the Siege of Boston, a Committee of Congress in 1797
reported, that, “as Government has not adopted a general
rule to compensate individuals who have suffered in
a similar manner, the Committee are of opinion that the
prayer of this petition cannot be granted.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> At a later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
day, however, after successive favorable reports, the
claim was finally in 1833 allowed, and compensation
made to the extent of the estimated value of the property
destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In 1815 a claimant received compensation for a house
at the end of the Potomac bridge, which was blown up
to prevent certain public stores from falling into the
hands of the enemy;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and other claimants at Baltimore
received compensation for rope-walks burnt in the defence
of the city.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The report of a committee in another
case says that the course of Congress “seems to inculcate
that indemnity is due to all those <i>whose losses have
arisen from the acts of our own Government, or those acting
under its authority</i>, while losses produced by the
conduct of the enemy are to be classed among the unavoidable
calamities of war.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This is the most complete
statement of the rule which I find.</p>

<p>After the Battle of New Orleans the question of the
application of this rule was presented repeatedly, and
with various results. In one case, a claim for “a quantity
of fencing” used as fuel by troops of General Jackson
was paid by Congress; so also was a claim for damages
to a plantation “upon which public works for the
defence of the country were erected.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> On the other
hand, a claim for “an elegant and well-furnished house”
which afforded shelter to the British army and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
therefore fired on with hot shot, also a claim for damage
to a house and plantation where a battery was erected
by our troops, and on both of which claims the
Committee, simultaneously with the two former, reported
favorably, were disallowed by Congress.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In a subsequent
case both the report and action seem to have
proceeded on a different principle from that previously
enunciated. At the landing of the enemy near New
Orleans, the levee was cut in order to annoy him. As
a consequence, the plantation of the claimant was inundated,
and suffered damages estimated at $19,250.
But the claim was rejected, on the ground that “the
injury was done in the necessary operations of war.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Certainly this ground may be adopted in the present
case, while it must not be forgotten that in all the
foregoing cases the claimants were citizens within our
own jurisdiction, whose property had been used against
a foreign enemy.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of claims arising in the War of 1812
prompted an Act of Congress in 1816 for “the payment
for property lost, captured, or destroyed by the enemy.”
In this Act it was, among other things, provided,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That any person, who, in the time aforesaid [the late war],
has sustained damage by the destruction of his or her house
or building by the enemy, while the same was occupied as a
military deposit, under the authority of an officer or agent of
the United States, shall be allowed and paid the amount of
such damage, provided it shall appear that such occupation
was the cause of its destruction.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Two years later it was found, that, in order to obtain
the benefits of this Act, people, especially on the frontier
of the State of New York, had not hesitated at “fraud,
forgery, and perhaps perjury.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Thereupon, the law,
which by its terms was limited to two years, and which
it had been proposed to extend, was permitted to expire;
and it is accordingly now marked in our Statutes,
“Obsolete.” But it is not without its lesson. It shows
what may be expected, should any precedent be adopted
by Congress to quicken the claimants now dormant in
the South. “It is the duty of a good Government to
attend to the morals of the people as an affair of primary
concern.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> So said the Committee in 1818, recommending
the non-extension of the Act. But this warning
is as applicable now as then.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the claimants of the present day there are
doubtless many of character and virtue. It is hard to
vote against them. But I cannot be controlled on this
occasion by my sympathies. Everywhere and in every
household there has been suffering which mortal power
cannot measure. Sometimes it is borne in silence and
solitude; sometimes it is manifest to all. In coming
into this Chamber and asking for compensation, it invites
comparison with other instances. If your allowance
is to be on account of merit, who will venture to
say that this case is the most worthy? It is before us
now for judgment. But there are others, not now before
us, where the suffering has been greater, and where, I do
not hesitate to say, the reward should be in proportion.
This is an appeal for justice. Therefore do I say, in the
name of justice, Wait!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 15th, the same bill being under discussion, Mr. Sumner
spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>There is another point, on which I forbore to dwell
with sufficient particularity when I spoke before. It is
this: Assuming that this claimant is loyal, I honor her
that she kept her loyalty under the surrounding pressure
of rebellion. Of course this was her duty,&mdash;nor
more nor less. The practical question is, Shall she be
paid for it? Had she been disloyal, there would have
been no proposition of compensation. As the liability
of the Nation is urged on the single ground that she
kept her regard for the flag truly and sincerely, it is
evident that this loyalty must be put beyond question;
it must be established like any other essential link of
evidence. I think I do not err in supposing that it
is not established in the present case,&mdash;at least with
such certainty as to justify opening the doors of the
Treasury.</p>

<p>But assuming that in fact the loyalty is established, I
desire to go further, and say that not only is the present
claim without any support in law, but it is unreasonable.
The Rebel States had become one immense prison-house
of Loyalty; Alabama was a prison-house. The
Nation, at every cost of treasure and blood, broke into
that prison-house, and succeeded in rescuing the Loyalists;
but the terrible effort, which cost the Nation so
dearly, involved the Loyalists in losses also. In breaking
into the prison-house and dislodging the Rebel keepers,
property of Loyalists suffered. And now we are
asked to pay for this property damaged in our efforts for
their redemption. Our troops came down to break the
prison-doors and set the captives free. Is it not unreasonable
to expect us to pay for this breaking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>If the forces of the United States had failed, then
would these Loyalists have lost everything, country,
property, and all,&mdash;that is, if really loyal, according to
present professions. It was our national forces that
saved them from this sacrifice, securing to them country,
and, if not all their property, much of it. A part of
the property of the present claimant was taken in order
to save to her all else, including country itself. It was
a case, such as might occur under other circumstances,
where a part&mdash;and a very small part&mdash;is sacrificed in
order to save the rest. According to all analogies of
jurisprudence, and the principles of justice itself, the
claimant can look for nothing beyond such contribution
as Congress in its bounty may appropriate. It is a case
of bounty, and not of law.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose, as has been most earnestly
argued, that a claimant of approved loyalty in
the Rebel States should have compensation precisely
like a similar claimant in a Loyal State. To my mind
this assumption is founded on a misapprehension of
the Constitution, the law, and the reason of the case,&mdash;three
different misapprehensions. By the Constitution
property cannot be taken for public use without
“just compensation”; but this rule was silent in the
Rebel States. International Law stepped in and supplied
a different rule. And when we consider how
much was saved to the loyal citizen in a Rebel State
by the national arms, it will be found that this rule is
only according to justice.</p>

<p>I have no disposition to shut the door upon claimants.
Let them be heard; but the hearing must be according
to some system, so that Congress shall know the
character and extent of these claims. Before the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of my colleague,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I had already prepared instructions for
the Committee, which I will read, as expressing my own
conclusion on this matter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the committee to whom this bill shall be referred,
the Committee on Claims, be instructed to consider the expediency
of providing for the appointment of a commission
whose duty it shall be to inquire into the claims of the loyal
citizens of the National Government arising during the recent
Rebellion anywhere in the United States, classifying these
claims, specifying their respective amounts, and the circumstances
out of which they originated, also, the evidence of
loyalty adduced by the claimants respectively, to the end
that Congress may know precisely the extent and character
of these claims before legislating thereupon.”</p>

</div>

<p>As this is a resolution of instruction, simply to consider
the expediency of what is proposed, I presume
there can be no objection to it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Afterwards, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the bill, with all pending
propositions, was recommitted to the Committee on Claims.</p>

<h2><a name="TRIBUTE_TO_HON_JAMES_HINDS_REPRESENTATIVE" id="TRIBUTE_TO_HON_JAMES_HINDS_REPRESENTATIVE"></a>TRIBUTE TO HON. JAMES HINDS, REPRESENTATIVE
OF ARKANSAS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, January 23, 1869.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Hinds, while engaged in canvassing the State of Arkansas on
the Republican side, was assassinated. The Senators of Arkansas requested
Mr. Sumner to speak on the resolution announcing his death.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It is with hesitation that I
add a word on this melancholy occasion, and I do
it only in compliance with the suggestion of others.</p>

<p>I did not know Mr. Hinds personally; but I have
been interested in his life, and touched by his tragical
end. Born in New York, educated in Ohio, a settler in
Minnesota, and then a citizen of Arkansas, he carried
with him always the energies and principles ripened
under our Northern skies. He became a Representative
in Congress, and, better still, a vindicator of the Rights
of Man. Unhappily, that barbarism which we call Slavery
is not yet dead, and it was his fate to fall under its
vindictive assault. Pleading for the Equal Rights of All,
he became a victim and martyr.</p>

<p>Thus suddenly arrested in life, his death is a special
sorrow, not only to family and friends, but to the country
which he had begun to serve so well. The void,
when a young man dies, is measured less by what he
has done than by the promises of the future. Performance
itself is forgotten in the ample assurance afforded
by character. Already Mr. Hinds had given himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sincerely and bravely to the good cause. By presence
and speech he was urging those great principles of the
Declaration of Independence whose complete recognition
will be the cope-stone of our Republic, when he fell
by the stealthy shot of an assassin. It was in the midst
of this work that he fell, and on this account I am glad
to offer my tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>As the life he led was not without honor, so his death
is not without consolation. It was the saying of Antiquity,
that it is sweet to die for country. Here was
death not only for country, but for mankind. Nor is it
to be forgotten, that, dying in such a cause, his living
voice is echoed from the tomb. There is a testimony in
death often greater than in any life. The cause for
which a man dies lives anew in his death. “If the assassination
could trammel up the consequence,” then
might the assassin find some other satisfaction than the
gratification of a barbarous nature. But this cannot be.
His own soul is blasted; the cause he sought to kill is
elevated; and thus it is now. The assassin is a fugitive
in some unknown retreat; the cause is about to triumph.</p>

<p>Often it happens that death, which takes away life,
confers what life alone cannot give. It makes famous.
History does not forget Lovejoy, who for devotion to the
cause of the slave was murdered by a fanatical mob; and
it has already enshrined Abraham Lincoln in holiest
keeping. Another is added to the roll,&mdash;less exalted
than Lincoln, less early in immolation than Lovejoy,
but, like these two, to be remembered always among
those who passed out of life through the gate of sacrifice.</p>

</div>

<p>On this he spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In the construction of a machine
the good mechanic seeks the simplest
process, producing the desired result with the greatest
economy of time and force. I know no better rule for
Congress on the present occasion. We are mechanics,
and the machine we are constructing has for its object
the conservation of Equal Rights. Surely, if we are
wise, we shall seek the simplest process, producing the
desired result with the greatest economy of time and
force. How widely Senators are departing from this
rule will appear before I have done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rarely have I entered upon any debate in this Chamber
with a sense of sadness so heavy as oppresses me at
this moment. It was sad enough to meet the champions
of Slavery, as in other days they openly vindicated
the monstrous pretension and claimed for it the safeguard
of the Constitution, insisting that Slavery was
national and Freedom sectional. But this was not so
sad as now, after a bloody war with Slavery, and its defeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on the battle-field, to meet the champions of a kindred
pretension, for which they claim the safeguard of
the Constitution, insisting also, as in the case of Slavery,
upon State Rights. The familiar vindication of Slavery
in those early debates was less sickening than the vindication
now of the intolerable pretension, that a State,
constituting part of the Nation, and calling itself “Republican,”
is entitled to shut out any citizen from participation
in government simply on account of race or
color. To denominate such pretension as intolerable
expresses very inadequately the extent of its absurdity,
and the utterness of its repugnance to all good principles,
whether of reason, morals, or government.</p>

<p>I make no question with individual Senators; I make
no personal allusion; but I meet the odious imposture,
as I met the earlier imposture, with indignation and
contempt, naturally excited by anything unworthy of
this Chamber and unworthy of the Republic. How it
can enter here and find Senators willing to assume the
stigma of its championship is more than I can comprehend.
Nobody ever vindicated Slavery, who did not lay
up a store of regret for himself and his children; and
permit me to say now, nobody can vindicate Inequality
and Caste, whether civil or political, the direct offspring
of Slavery, as intrenched in the Constitution, beyond the
reach of national prohibition, without laying up a similar
store of regret. Death may happily come to remove
the champion from the judgment of the world; but History
will make its faithful record, to be read with sorrow
hereafter. Do not complain, if I speak strongly. The
occasion requires it. I seek to save the Senate from
participation in an irrational and degrading pretension.</p>

<p>Others may be cool and indifferent; but I have warred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
with Slavery too long, in all its different forms, not to
be aroused when this old enemy shows its head under
an <i>alias</i>. Once it was Slavery; now it is Caste; and
the same excuse is assigned now as then. In the name
of State Rights, Slavery, with all its brood of wrong,
was upheld; and now, in the name of State Rights,
Caste, fruitful also in wrong, is upheld. The old champions
reappear under other names and from other States,
each crying out, that, under the National Constitution,
notwithstanding even its supplementary Amendments, a
State may, if it pleases, deny political rights on account
of race or color, and thus establish that vilest institution,
a Caste and an Oligarchy of the Skin.</p>

<p>This perversity, which to careless observation seems
so incomprehensible, is easily understood, when it is
considered that the present generation grew up under
an interpretation of the National Constitution supplied
by the upholders of Slavery. State Rights were exalted
and the Nation was humbled, because in this way Slavery
might be protected. Anything for Slavery was
constitutional. Such was the lesson we were taught.
How often I have heard it! How often it has sounded
through this Chamber, and been proclaimed in speech
and law! Under its influence the Right of Petition was
denied, the atrocious Fugitive Slave Bill was enacted,
and the claim was advanced that Slavery travelled with
the flag of the Republic. Vain are all our victories, if
this terrible rule is not reversed, so that State Rights
shall yield to Human Rights, and the Nation be exalted
as the bulwark of all. This will be the crowning victory
of the war. Beyond all question, the true rule under
the National Constitution, especially since its additional
Amendments, is, that <i>anything for Human Rights is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
constitutional</i>. Yes, Sir; against the old rule, <i>Anything
for Slavery</i>, I put the new rule, <i>Anything for Human
Rights</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir, I do not declare this rule hastily, and I know the
presence in which I speak. I am surrounded by lawyers,
and now I challenge any one or all to this debate.
I invoke the discussion. On an occasion less important,
Mr. Pitt, afterwards Lord Chatham, after saying that he
came not “with the statute-book doubled down in dog’s-ears
to defend the cause of Liberty,” that he relied on
“a general principle, a constitutional principle,” exclaimed:
“It is a ground on which I stand firm, on
which I dare meet any man.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In the same spirit I
would speak now. No learning in books, no skill acquired
in courts, no sharpness of forensic dialectics, no
cunning in splitting hairs can impair the vigor of the
constitutional principle which I announce. Whatever
you enact for Human Rights is constitutional. There
can be no State Rights against Human Rights; and this
is the supreme law of the land, anything in the Constitution
or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>A State exercises its proper function, when, within its
own jurisdiction, it administers local law, watches local
interests, promotes local charities, and by local knowledge
brings the guardianship of Government to the home
of the citizen. Such is the proper function of the State,
by which we are saved from that centralization elsewhere
so absorbing. But a State transcends its proper
function, when it interferes with those Equal Rights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
whether civil or political, which by the Declaration of
Independence and repeated texts of the National Constitution
are under the safeguard of the Nation. The
State is local in character, and not universal. Whatever
is justly local belongs to its cognizance; whatever is
universal belongs to the Nation. But what can be more
universal than the Rights of Man? They are for “all
men,”&mdash;not for all white men, but for all men. Such
they have been declared by our fathers, and this axiom
of Liberty nobody can dispute.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Listening to the champions of Caste and Oligarchy
under the National Constitution, and perusing their
writings, I think I understand the position they take.
With as much calmness as I can command, I note what
they have to say in speech and in print. I know it all.
I do not err, when I say that this whole terrible and
ignominious pretension is traced to direct and barefaced
perversion of the National Constitution. Search history,
study constitutions, examine laws, and you will find no
perversion more thoroughly revolting. By the National
Constitution it is provided, that “the electors in each
State shall have the <i>qualifications</i> requisite for electors
of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature,”&mdash;thus
seeming to refer the primary determination of
what are called “qualifications” to the States; and this
is reinforced by the further provision, that “the times,
places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and
Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the
Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time
by law make or alter such <i>regulations</i>.” This is all
On these simple texts, conferring plain and intelligible
powers, the champions insist that “color” may be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a “qualification,” and that under the guise of “regulations”
citizens whose only offence is a skin not colored
like our own may be shut out from political rights,&mdash;and
that in this way a monopoly of rights, being at once
a Caste and an Oligarchy of the Skin, is placed under
the safeguard of the National Constitution. Such is
the case of the champions; this is their stock-in-trade.
With all their learning, all their subtlety, all their sharpness,
this is what they have to say in behalf of an infamous
pretension under the National Constitution. Everything
from them begins and ends in a perversion of
two words,&mdash;“qualifications” and “regulations.”</p>

<p>Now to this perversion I oppose point-blank denial.
These two words are not justly susceptible of any such
signification, especially in a National Constitution, which
is to be interpreted always so that Human Rights shall
not suffer. I do not stop now for dictionaries. The case
is too plain. A “qualification” is something that can be
acquired. A man is familiarly said to “qualify” for an
office. Nothing can be a “qualification” which is not
in its nature attainable,&mdash;as residence, property, education,
or character, each of which is within the possible
reach of well-directed effort. Color cannot be a “qualification.”
If the prescribed “qualification” were color
of the hair or color of the eyes, all would see its absurdity;
but it is none the less absurd, when it is color of the
skin. Here is an unchangeable condition, impressed by
Providence. Are we not reminded that the leopard cannot
change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin? These
are two examples of enduring conditions. Color is a
quality from Nature. But a “quality” is very different
from a “qualification.” A quality inherent in man and
part of himself can never be a “qualification” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sense of the National Constitution. On other occasions
I have cited authorities,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and shown how this attempt
to foist into the National Constitution a pernicious
meaning is in defiance of all approved definition, as it
is plainly repugnant to reason, justice, and common
sense.</p>

<p>The same judgment must be pronounced on the attempt
to found this outrage upon the power to make
“regulations,”&mdash;as if this word had not a limited signification
which renders such a pretension impossible.
“Regulations” are nothing but rules applicable to a
given matter; they concern the manner in which a
business shall be conducted, and, when used with regard
to elections, are applicable to what may be called
incidents, in contradistinction to the principal, which is
nothing less than the right to vote. A power to regulate
is not a power to destroy or to disfranchise. In
an evil hour Human Rights may be struck down, but
it cannot be merely by “regulations.” The pretension
that under such authority this great wrong may be
done is another illustration of that extravagance which
the champions do not shrink from avowing.</p>

<p>The whole structure of Caste and Oligarchy, as founded
on two words, may be dismissed. It is hard even to
think of it without impatience, to speak of it without
denouncing it as unworthy of human head or human
heart. There are honorable Senators who shrink from
any direct argument on these two words, and, wrapping
themselves in pleonastic phrase, content themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the general assertion, that power over suffrage belongs to
the States. But they cannot maintain this conclusion
without founding on these two words,&mdash;insisting that
color may be a “qualification,” and that under the narrow
power to make “regulations” a race may be broadly
disfranchised. To this wretched pretension are they
driven. And now, if there be any such within the sound
of my voice, I ask the question directly,&mdash;Can “color,”
whether of hair, eyes, or skin, be a “qualification” under
our National Constitution? under the pretence of making
“regulations” of elections, can a race be disfranchised?
With all the power derived from both these
words, can any State undertake to establish a Caste and
organize an Oligarchy of the Skin? To put these questions
is to answer them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the case as presented by the champions. But
looking at the National Constitution, we shall be astonished
still more at this pretension. On other occasions
I have gone over the whole case of Human Rights vs.
State Rights under the National Constitution. For the
present I content myself with allusions only to the principal
points.</p>

<p>It is under the National Constitution that the champions
set up their pretension; therefore to the National
Constitution I go. And I begin by appealing to the
letter, which from beginning to end does not contain
one word recognizing “color.” Its letter is blameless;
and its spirit is not less so. Surely a power to disfranchise
for color must find some sanction in the Constitution.
There must be some word of clear intent under
which this terrible prerogative can be exercised. This
conclusion of reason is reinforced by the positive text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of our Magna Charta, the Declaration of Independence,
where it is expressly announced that all men are equal
in rights, and that just government stands only on the
consent of the governed. In the face of the National
Constitution, interpreted, first by itself, and then by the
Declaration of Independence, how can this pretension
prevail?</p>

<p>But there are positive texts of the National Constitution,
refulgent as the Capitol itself, which forbid it with
sovereign, irresistible power, and invest Congress with
all needful authority to maintain the prohibition.</p>

<p>There is that key-stone clause, by which it is expressly
declared that “the United States shall guaranty to every
State in this Union a republican form of government”;
and Congress is empowered to enforce this guaranty.
The definition of a republican government was solemnly
announced by our fathers, first, in that great battle-cry
which preceded the Revolution, “Taxation without representation
is tyranny,” and, secondly, in the great Declaration
at the birth of the Republic, that all men are
equal in rights, and that just government stands only on
the consent of the governed. A Republic is where taxation
and representation go hand in hand, where all are
equal in rights, and no man is excluded from participation
in the government. Such is the definition of a republican
government, which it is the duty of Congress
to maintain. Here is a bountiful source of power, which
cannot be called in question. In the execution of the
guaranty Congress may&mdash;nay, must&mdash;require that there
shall be no Inequality, Caste, or Oligarchy of the Skin.</p>

<p>I know well the arguments of the champions. They
insist that the definition of a Republican Government is
to be found in the State Constitutions at the adoption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the National Constitution; and as all these, except
Massachusetts, recognized Slavery, they find that the
denial of Human Rights is republican. But the champions
forget that Slavery was regarded as a temporary
exception,&mdash;that the slave, who was not represented,
was not taxed,&mdash;that he was not part of the “body-politic,”&mdash;that
the difference at that time was not between
white and black, but between slave and freeman, precisely
as in the days of Magna Charta,&mdash;that in most
of the States all freemen, without distinction of color,
were citizens,&mdash;and that, according to the history of
the times, there was no State which ventured to announce
in its Constitution a discrimination founded on
color, except Virginia, Georgia, and South Carolina,&mdash;this
last the persevering enemy of republican government
for successive generations; so that, if we look at the
State Constitutions, we find that they also testify to
the true definition.</p>

<p>There are words of authority which the champions
forget also. They forget Magna Charta, that great title-deed
called “the most august diploma and sacred anchor
of English liberties,” where, after declaring that “there
shall be but <i>one measure</i> throughout the realm,”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> it is
announced in memorable words, that “<i>no freeman</i> shall
be disseized of his freehold or liberties but by legal judgment
of his peers or by the law of the land,”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> meaning,
of course, the law of the whole land, <i>in contradistinction
to any local law</i>. The words with which this great
guaranty begin still resound: <i>Nullus liber homo</i>, “No
freeman,” shall be denied the liberties which belong to
freemen.</p>

<p>The champions also forget that “The Federalist,” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
commending the Constitution, at the time of its adoption,
insisted, that, if the slaves became free, they would
be entitled to representation. I have quoted the potent
words before,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and now I quote them again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed
the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is
denied to them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted,
that, if the laws were to restore the rights which have
been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an
equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The champions also forget, that, in the debates on the
ratification of the National Constitution, it was charged
by its opponents, and admitted by its friends, that Congress
was empowered to correct any inequality of suffrage.
I content myself with quoting the weighty words
of Madison in the Virginia Convention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some States might regulate the elections on the principles
of <i>Equality</i>, and others might regulate them otherwise.…
Should the people of any State by any means be deprived
of the right of suffrage, <i>it was judged proper that it
should be remedied by the General Government</i>.… If the
elections be regulated properly by the State Legislatures, the
Congressional control will very probably never be exercised.
The power appears to me satisfactory, and as unlikely to be
abused as any part of the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The champions also forget that Chief Justice Taney,
in that very Dred Scott decision where it was ruled that
a person of African descent could not be a citizen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
United States, admitted, that, if he were once a citizen,
that is, if he were once admitted to be a component part
of the body-politic, he would be entitled to the equal
privileges of citizenship. Here are some of his emphatic
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is not, it is believed, to be found in the theories of
writers on Government, or in any actual experiment heretofore
tried, an exposition of the term <i>citizen</i> which has not
been understood as conferring <i>the actual possession and enjoyment,
or the perfect right of acquisition and enjoyment, of an
entire equality of privileges, civil and political</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus from every authority, early and late,&mdash;from
Magna Charta, wrung out of King John at Runnymede,&mdash;from
Hamilton, writing in “The Federalist,”&mdash;from
Madison, speaking in the Convention at Richmond,&mdash;from
Taney, presiding in the Supreme Court of the
United States,&mdash;is there one harmonious testimony to
the equal rights of citizenship.</p>

<p>If in the original text of the Constitution there could
be any doubt, it was all relieved by the Amendment
abolishing Slavery and empowering Congress to enforce
this provision. Already Congress, in the exercise of this
power, has passed a <i>Civil Rights Act</i>. It only remains
that it should now pass a <i>Political Rights Act</i>, which,
like the former, shall help consummate the abolition of
Slavery. According to a familiar rule of interpretation,
expounded by Chief Justice Marshall in his most
masterly judgment, Congress, when intrusted with any
power, is at liberty to select the “means” for its execution.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The Civil Rights Act came under the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
“means” selected by Congress, and a Political Rights
Act will have the same authority. You may as well
deny the constitutionality of the one as of the other.</p>

<p>The Amendment abolishing Slavery has been reinforced
by another, known as Article XIV., which declares
peremptorily that “no State shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States,” and again Congress
is empowered to enforce this provision. What can be
broader? Colored persons are citizens of the United
States, and no State can abridge their privileges or immunities.
It is a mockery to say, that, under these explicit
words, Congress is powerless to forbid any discrimination
of color at the ballot-box. Why, then, were
they inscribed in the Constitution? To what end?
There they stand, supplying additional and supernumerary
power, ample for safeguard against Caste or Oligarchy
of the Skin, no matter how strongly sanctioned
by any State Government.</p>

<p>But the champions, anxious for State Rights against
Human Rights, strive to parry this positive text, by insisting,
that, in another provision of this same Amendment,
the power over the right to vote is conceded to the
States. Mark, now, the audacity and fragility of this
pretext. It is true, that, “when the right to vote …
is denied to any of the male inhabitants of a State,
… or in any way abridged, except for participation in
rebellion or other crime,” the basis of representation is
reduced in corresponding proportion. Such is the penalty
imposed by the Constitution on a State which denies
the right to vote, except in a specific case. But this
penalty on the State does not in any way, by the most
distant implication, impair the plenary powers of Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to enforce the guaranty of a republican government,
the abolition of Slavery, and that final clause
guarding the rights of citizens,&mdash;three specific powers
which are left undisturbed, unless the old spirit of Slavery
is once more revived, and Congress is compelled
again to wear those degrading chains which for so long
a time rendered it powerless for Human Rights.</p>

<p>The pretension, that the powers of Congress, derived
from the Constitution and its supplementary texts, were
all foreclosed, and that the definition of a republican
government was dishonored, merely by the indirect operation
of the clause imposing a penalty upon a State,
is the last effort of the champions. They are driven to
the assumption, that all these beneficent powers have
been taken away by indirection, and that a provision
evidently temporary and limited can have this overwhelming
consequence. They set up a technical rule of
law, “<i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>.” It is impossible
to see the application of this technicality. Because
the basis of representation is reduced in proportion to
any denial of the right to vote, therefore, it is argued,
the denial of the right to vote is placed beyond the
reach of Congress, notwithstanding all its plenary powers
from so many sources. It is enough to say of this
conclusion, that it is as strong as anything founded on the
“argal” of the grave-digger in “Hamlet.” Really, Sir,
it is too bad that so great a cause should be treated with
such levity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, I make haste to the conclusion. Unwilling
to protract this debate, I open the question in
glimpses only. Even in this imperfect way, it is clearly
seen, first, that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the National Constitution to sustain the pretension of
Caste or Oligarchy of the Skin, as set up by certain
States,&mdash;and, secondly, that there is in the National
Constitution a succession and reduplication of powers
investing Congress with ample authority to repress any
such pretension. In this conclusion, I raise no question
on the power of States to regulate the suffrage; I do not
ask Congress to undertake any such regulation. I simply
propose, that, under the pretence of regulating the
suffrage, States shall not exercise a prerogative hostile
to Human Rights, without any authority under the
National Constitution, and in defiance of its positive
texts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am now brought directly to the proposed Amendment
of the Constitution. Of course, the question stares
us in the face, Why amend what is already sufficient?
Why erect a supernumerary column?</p>

<p>So far as I know, two reasons are assigned. The first
is, that the power of Congress is doubtful. It is natural
that those who do not sympathize strongly with the
Equal Rights of All should doubt. Men ordinarily find
in the Constitution what is in themselves; so that the
Constitution in its meaning is little more than a reflection
of their own inner nature. As I am unable to find
any ground of doubt, in substance or even in shadow, I
shrink from a proposition which assumes that there is
doubt. To my mind the power is too clear for question.
As well question the obligation of Congress to guaranty
a republican form of government, or the abolition of
Slavery, or the prohibition upon States to interfere with
the rights and privileges of citizenship, each of which is
beyond question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Another reason assigned for a Constitutional Amendment
is, its permanent character in comparison with an
Act of Congress, which may be repealed. On this head
I have no anxiety. Let this beneficent prohibition once
find place in our statute-book, and it will be lasting as
the National Constitution itself, to which it will be only
a legitimate corollary. In harmony with the Declaration
of Independence, and in harmony with the National
Constitution, it will become of equal significance, and no
profane hand will touch its sacred text. It will never
be repealed. The elective franchise, once recognized,
can never be denied,&mdash;once conferred, can never be
resumed. The rule of Equal Rights, once applied by
Congress under the National Constitution, will be a
permanent institution as long as the Republic endures;
for it will be a vital part of that Republican Government
to which the nation is pledged.</p>

<p>Dismissing the reasons for the Amendment, I turn to
those which make us hesitate. There are two. The
Amendment admits, that, under the National Constitution
as it is, with its recent additions, a Caste and an
Oligarchy of the Skin may be set up by a State without
any check from Congress; that these ignoble forms of
inequality are consistent with republican government;
and that the right to vote is not an existing privilege
and immunity of citizenship. All this is plainly admitted
by the proposed Amendment,&mdash;thus despoiling
Congress of beneficent powers, and emasculating the
National Constitution itself. It is only with infinite
reluctance that I consent to any such admission, which,
in the endeavor to satisfy ungenerous scruples, weakens
all those texts which are so important for Human
Rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The hesitation to present the Amendment is increased,
when we consider the difficulties in the way of its ratification.
I am no arithmetician, but I understand that
nobody has yet been able to enumerate the States whose
votes can be counted on to assure its ratification within
any reasonable time. Meanwhile this great question,
which cannot brook delay, which for the sake of peace
and to complete Reconstruction should be settled at
once, is handed over to prolonged controversy in the
States. I need not depict the evils which must ensue.
A State will become for the time a political caldron, into
which will be dropped all the poisoned ingredients of
prejudice and hate, while a powerful political party,
chanting, like the Witches in “Macbeth,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Double, double, toil and trouble;</div>
<div class="verse">Fire, burn; and, caldron, bubble,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">will use this very Amendment as the pudding-stick with
which to stir the bubbling mass. Such a controversy
should be avoided, if possible; nor should an agitation
so unwelcome and so sterile be needlessly invited. “Let
us have peace.”</p>

<p>Of course, if there were no other way of accomplishing
the great result, the Amendment should be presented,
even with all its delays, uncertainties, and provocations
to local strife. But happily all these are unnecessary.
The same thing may be accomplished by Act of Congress,
without any delay, without any uncertainty, and
without any provocation to local strife. The same vote
of two thirds required for the presentation of the Amendment
will pass the Act over the veto of the President.
Once adopted, it will go into instant operation, without
waiting for the uncertain concurrence of State Legislatures,
and without provoking local strife so wearisome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the country. The States will not be turned into political
caldrons, and the Democratic party will have no
pudding-stick with which to stir the bubbling mass.</p>

<p>I do not depart from the proprieties of this occasion,
when I show how completely the course I now propose
harmonizes with the requirements of the political party
to which I belong. Believing most sincerely that the
Republican party, in its objects, is identical with country
and with mankind, so that in sustaining it I sustain
these comprehensive charities, I cannot willingly see this
agency lose the opportunity of confirming its supremacy.
You need votes in Connecticut, do you not? There are
three thousand fellow-citizens in that State ready at the
call of Congress to take their place at the ballot-box.
You need them also in Pennsylvania, do you not?
There are at least fifteen thousand in that great State
waiting for your summons. Wherever you most need
them, there they are; and be assured they will all vote
for those who stand by them in the assertion of Equal
Rights. In standing by them you stand by all that is
most dear in the Republic.</p>

<p>Pardon me,&mdash;but, if you are not moved by considerations
of justice under the Constitution, then I appeal
to that humbler motive which is found in the desire for
success. Do this and you will assure the triumph of
all that you can most desire. Party, country, mankind,
will be elevated, while the Equal Rights of All will be
fixed on a foundation not less enduring than the Rock
of Ages.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;A report recommending that
the Senate do not advise and consent to a treaty
with a foreign power, duly signed by the plenipotentiary
of the nation, is of rare occurrence. Treaties are often
reported with amendments, and sometimes without any
recommendation; but I do not recall an instance, since
I came into the Senate, where such a treaty has been
reported with the recommendation which is now under
consideration. The character of the treaty seemed to
justify the exceptional report. The Committee did not
hesitate in the conclusion that it ought to be rejected,
and they have said so.</p>

<p>I do not disguise the importance of this act; but I
believe that in the interest of peace, which every one
should have at heart, the treaty must be rejected. A
treaty, which, instead of removing an existing grievance,
leaves it for heart-burning and rancor, cannot be considered
a settlement of pending questions between two nations.
It may seem to settle them, but does not. It is
nothing but a snare. And such is the character of the
treaty now before us. The massive grievance under
which our country suffered for years is left untouched;
the painful sense of wrong planted in the national heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
is allowed to remain. For all this there is not one word
of regret, or even of recognition; nor is there any semblance
of compensation. It cannot be for the interest of
either party that such a treaty should be ratified. It
cannot promote the interest of the United States, for we
naturally seek justice as the foundation of a good understanding
with Great Britain; nor can it promote the
interest of Great Britain, which must also seek a real
settlement of all pending questions. Surely I do not
err, when I say that a wise statesmanship, whether on
our side or on the other side, must apply itself to find
the real root of evil, and then, with courage tempered
by candor and moderation, see that it is extirpated.
This is for the interest of both parties, and anything
short of it is a failure. It is sufficient to say that the
present treaty does no such thing, and that, whatever
may have been the disposition of the negotiators, the
real root of evil remains untouched in all its original
strength.</p>

<p>I make these remarks merely to characterize the
treaty and prepare the way for its consideration.</p>

<h3>THE PENDING TREATY.</h3>

<p>If we look at the negotiation which immediately preceded
the treaty, we find little to commend. You have
it on your table. I think I am not mistaken, when I
say that it shows a haste which finds few precedents in
diplomacy, but which is explained by the anxiety to
reach a conclusion before the advent of a new Administration.
Mr. Seward and Mr. Reverdy Johnson unite
in this unprecedented activity, using the Atlantic cable
freely. I should not object to haste, or to the freest use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of the cable, if the result were such as could be approved;
but, considering the character of the transaction,
and how completely the treaty conceals the main
cause of offence, it seems as if the honorable negotiators
were engaged in huddling something out of sight.</p>

<p>The treaty has for its model the Claims Convention
of 1853. To take such a convention as a model was a
strange mistake. This convention was for the settlement
of outstanding claims of American citizens on Great
Britain, and of British subjects on the United States,
which had arisen since the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. It
concerned individuals only, and not the nation. It was
not in any respect political; nor was it to remove any
sense of national wrong. To take such a convention as
the model for a treaty which was to determine a national
grievance of transcendent importance in the relations of
two countries marked on the threshold an insensibility
to the true nature of the difference to be settled. At
once it belittled the work to be done.</p>

<p>An inspection of the treaty shows how from beginning
to end it is merely for the settlement of individual
claims on both sides, putting the two batches on an
equality, so that the sufferers by the misconduct of England
may be counterbalanced by British blockade-runners.
It opens with a preamble, which, instead of announcing
the unprecedented question between the two
countries, simply refers to individual claims that have
arisen since 1853,&mdash;the last time of settlement,&mdash;some
of which are still pending and remain unsettled. Who
would believe that under these words of commonplace
was concealed the unsettled difference which has already
so deeply stirred the American people, and is destined,
until finally adjusted, to occupy the attention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
civilized world? Nothing here gives notice of the real
question. I quote the preamble, as it is the key-note to
the treaty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas claims have at various times since the exchange
of the ratifications of the convention between Great Britain
and the United States of America, signed at London on the
8th of February, 1853, been made upon the Government of
her Britannic Majesty on the part of citizens of the United
States, and upon the Government of the United States on
the part of subjects of her Britannic Majesty; and whereas
<i>some of such claims are still pending and remain unsettled</i>;
her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, and the President of the United States of
America, being of opinion that a speedy and equitable settlement
of all such claims will contribute much to the maintenance
of the friendly feelings which subsist between the two
countries, have resolved to make arrangements for that purpose
by means of a convention.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The provisions of the treaty are for the trial of these
cases. A commission is constituted, which is empowered
to choose an arbitrator; but, in the event of a failure to
agree, the arbitrator shall be determined “by lot” from
two persons, one named by each side. Even if this aleatory
proceeding were a proper device in the umpirage of
private claims, it is strangely inconsistent with the solemnity
which belongs to the present question. The
moral sense is disturbed by such a process at any stage
of the trial; nor is it satisfied by the subsequent provision
for the selection of a sovereign or head of a friendly
state as arbitrator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The treaty not merely makes no provision for the determination
of the great question, but it seems to provide
expressly that it shall never hereafter be presented. A
petty provision for individual claims, subject to a set-off
by the individual claims of England, so that in the end
our country may possibly receive nothing, is the consideration
for this strange surrender. I borrow a term from
an English statesman on another occasion, if I call it a
“capitulation.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> For the settlement of a few individual
claims, we condone the original far-reaching and destructive
wrong. Here are the plain words by which
this is done:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The high contracting parties engage to consider the result
of the proceedings of this commission as a full and final settlement
of every claim upon either Government arising out of
any transaction of a date prior to the exchange of the ratifications
of the present convention; and further engage that
every such claim, whether or not the same may have been
presented to the notice of, made, preferred, or laid before the
said commission, shall, from and after the conclusion of the
proceedings of the said commission, be considered and treated
as finally settled and barred, and thenceforth inadmissible.”</p>

</div>

<p>All this I quote directly from the treaty. It is Article
V. The national cause is handled as nothing more
than a bundle of individual claims, and the result of the
proceedings under the proposed treaty is to be “a full
and final settlement,” so that hereafter all claims “shall
be considered and treated as finally settled and barred,
and thenceforth inadmissible.” Here is no provision for
the real question, which, though thrust out of sight, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
declared to be “finally settled and barred,” according to
the terms of the treaty, must return to plague the two
countries. Whatever the treaty may say in terms, there
is no settlement in fact; and until this is made, there
will be constant menace of discord. Nor can it be forgotten
that there is no recognition of the rule of international
duty applicable to such cases. This, too, is left
unsettled.</p>

<p>While doing so little for us, the treaty makes ample
provision for all known claims on the British side. As
these are exclusively “individual,” they are completely
covered by the text, which has no limitations or exceptions.
Already it is announced in England that even
those of “Confederate bondholders” are included. I
have before me an English journal which describes the
latter claims as founded on “immense quantities of cotton,
worth at the time of their seizure nearly two shillings
a pound, which were then in the legal possession
of those bondholders”; and the same authority adds,
“These claims will be brought, indifferently with others,
before the designed joint commission, whenever it shall
sit.” From another quarter I learn that these bondholders
are “very sanguine of success <i>under the treaty as it
is worded</i>, and certain it is that the loan went up from 0
to 10 as soon as it was ascertained that the treaty was
signed.” I doubt if the American people are ready just
now to provide for any such claims. That they have risen
in the market is an argument against the treaty.</p>

<h3>THE CASE AGAINST ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>Passing from the treaty, I come now to consider
briefly, but with proper precision, the true ground of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
complaint; and here again we shall see the constant
inadequacy of the remedy now applied. It is with reluctance
that I enter upon this statement, and I do it
only in the discharge of a duty which cannot be postponed.</p>

<p>Close upon the outbreak of our troubles, little more
than one month after the bombardment of Fort Sumter,
when the Rebellion was still undeveloped, when the National
Government was beginning those gigantic efforts
which ended so triumphantly, the country was startled
by the news that the British Government had intervened
by a Proclamation which accorded belligerent rights to
the Rebels. At the early date when this was done, the
Rebels were, as they remained to the close, without ships
on the ocean, without prize courts or other tribunal for
the administration of justice on the ocean, <i>without any
of those conditions which are the essential prerequisites to
such a concession</i>; and yet the concession was general,
being applicable to the ocean and the land, so that by
British fiat they became ocean belligerents as well as
land belligerents. In the swiftness of this bestowal
there was very little consideration for a friendly power;
nor does it appear that there was any inquiry into those
<i>conditions-precedent</i> on which it must depend. Ocean
belligerency, being a “fact,” and not a “principle,” can
be recognized only on evidence showing its <i>actual existence</i>,
according to the rule first stated by Mr. Canning
and afterward recognized by Lord John Russell.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> But
no such evidence was adduced; for it did not exist, and
never has existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Too much stress cannot be laid upon the rule, that
belligerency is a “fact,” and not a “principle.” It is
perhaps the most important contribution to this discussion;
and its original statement, on the occasion of the
Greek Revolution, does honor to its author, unquestionably
the brightest genius ever directed to this subject.
According to this rule, belligerency must be proved to
exist; it must be shown. It cannot be imagined, or divined,
or invented; it must exist as a “fact” within the
knowledge of the world, or at least as a “fact” susceptible
of proof. Nor can it be inferred on the ocean
merely from its existence on the land. From the beginning,
when “God called the dry land Earth, and the
gathering together of the waters called He Seas,” the
two have been separate, and power over one has not
necessarily implied power over the other. There is a
dominion of the land, and a dominion of the ocean.
But, whatever power the Rebels possessed on the land,
they were always without power on the ocean. Admitting
that they were belligerents on the land, they were
never belligerents on the ocean.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make</div>
<div class="verse">Their clay creator the vain title take</div>
<div class="verse">Of lord of thee, <i>and arbiter of war</i>,”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">these they never possessed. Such was the “fact” that
must govern the present question. The rule, so simple,
plain, and intelligible, as stated by Mr. Canning, is a decisive
touchstone of the British concession, which, when
brought to it, is found to be without support.</p>

<p>Unfriendly in the precipitancy with which it was
launched, this concession was more unfriendly in substance.
It was the first stage in the depredations on our
commerce. Had it not been made, no Rebel ship could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
have been built in England: every step in her building
would have been piracy. Nor could any munitions of
war have been furnished: not a blockade-runner, laden
with supplies, could have left the English shores, except
under a kindred penalty. The direct consequence of
this concession was to place the Rebels on an equality
with ourselves in all British markets, whether of ships
or munitions of war. As these were open to the National
Government, so they were open to the Rebels.
The asserted neutrality between the two began by this
tremendous concession, when the Rebels, at one stroke,
were transformed not only into belligerents, but into
customers.</p>

<p>In attributing to that bad Proclamation this peculiar
influence I follow the authority of the Law Lords of
England, who, according to authentic report, announced
that without it the fitting out of a ship in England to
cruise against the United States would have been an act
of piracy. This conclusion was clearly stated by Lord
Chelmsford, ex-Chancellor, speaking for himself and
others, when he said: “If the Southern Confederacy
had not been recognized by us as <i>a belligerent power</i>,
he agreed with his noble and learned friend [Lord
Brougham], that any Englishman aiding them by fitting
out a privateer against the Federal Government <i>would
be guilty of piracy</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This conclusion is only according
to analogies of law. It is criminal for British subjects
to forge bombs or hand-grenades to be employed in the
assassination of a foreign sovereign at peace with England,
as when Bernard supplied from England the missiles
used by Orsini against the life of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Emperor,&mdash;all of which is illustrated by Lord Chief-Justice
Campbell, in his charge to the jury on the trial
of Bernard, and also by contemporaneous opinions of
Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Brougham, Lord Truro, and at an
earlier day by Lord Ellenborough in a case of libel on
the First Consul. That excellent authority, Sir George
Cornewall Lewis, gives a summary drawn from all these
opinions, when he says: “The obligation incumbent
upon a state of preventing her soil from being used <i>as
an arsenal</i>, in which the means of attack against a foreign
government may be collected and prepared for use, is
wholly independent of the form and character of that
government.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> As every government is constrained by
this rule, so every government is entitled to its safeguards.
There can be no reason why the life of our Republic
should be less sacred than the life of an Emperor,
or should enjoy less protection from British law. That
England became an “arsenal” for the Rebels we know;
but this could not have been, unless the Proclamation
had prepared the way.</p>

<p>The only justification that I have heard for this extraordinary
concession, which unleashed upon our country
the Furies of War to commingle with the Furies of Rebellion
at home, is, that President Lincoln undertook to
proclaim a <i>blockade</i> of the Rebel ports. By the use of
this word “blockade” the concession is vindicated. Had
President Lincoln proclaimed a <i>closing</i> of the Rebel
ports, there could have been no such concession. This
is a mere technicality; lawyers might call it an <i>apex
juris</i>; and yet on this sharp point England hangs her
defence. It is sufficient that in a great case like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
present, where the correlative duties of a friendly power
are in question, an act fraught with such portentous evil
cannot be vindicated on a technicality. In this debate
there is no room for technicality on either side. We
must look at the substance, and find a reason in nothing
short of overruling necessity. War cannot be justified
merely on a technicality; nor can the concession of
ocean belligerency to rebels without a port or prize court.
Such a concession, like war itself, must be at the peril of
the nation making it.</p>

<p>The British assumption, besides being offensive from
mere technicality, is inconsistent with the Proclamation
of the President, taken as a whole, which, while appointing
a blockade, is careful to reserve the rights of sovereignty,
thus putting foreign powers on their guard
against any premature concession. After declaring an
existing insurrection in certain States, and the obstruction
of the laws for the collection of the revenue, as the
motive for action, the President invokes not only the
Law of Nations, but “the laws of the United States,”
and, in further assertion of the national sovereignty, declares
Rebel cruisers to be pirates.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Clearly the Proclamation
must be taken as a whole, and its different provisions
so interpreted as to harmonize with each other.
If they cannot stand together, then it is the “blockade”
which must be modified by the national sovereignty,
and not the national sovereignty by the blockade. Such
should have been the interpretation of a friendly power,
especially when it is considered that there are numerous
precedents of what the great German authority, Heffter,
calls “Pacific Blockade,” or blockade without concession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of ocean belligerency,&mdash;as in the case of France, England,
and Russia against Turkey, 1827; France against
Mexico, 1837-39; France and Great Britain against
the Argentine Republic, 1838-48; Russia against the
Circassians, 1831-36, illustrated by the seizure of the
Vixen, so famous in diplomatic history.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Cases like
these led Heffter to lay down the rule, that “<i>blockade</i>”
does not necessarily constitute <i>a state of regular war</i>,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> as
was assumed by the British Proclamation, even in the
face of positive words by President Lincoln asserting
the national sovereignty and appealing to “the laws of
the United States.” The existence of such cases was
like a notice to the British Government against the
concession so rashly made. It was an all-sufficient
warning, which this power disregarded.</p>

<p>So far as is now known, the whole case for England is
made to stand on the use of the word “Blockade” by
President Lincoln. Had he used any other word, the
concession of belligerency would have been without justification,
even such as is now imagined. It was this
word which, with magical might, opened the gates to all
those bountiful supplies by which hostile expeditions
were equipped against the United States: it opened the
gates of war. Most appalling is it to think that one
little word, unconsciously used by a trusting President,
could be caught up by a friendly power and made to play
such a part.</p>

<p>I may add that there is one other word often invoked
for apology. It is “Neutrality,” which, it is said, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
proclaimed between two belligerents. Nothing could be
fairer, always provided that the “neutrality” proclaimed
did not begin with a concession to one party without
which this party would be powerless. Between two
established Nations, both independent, as between Russia
and France, there may be neutrality; for the two are
already equal in rights, and the proclamation would be
precisely equal in its operation. But where one party is
an established Nation, and the other is nothing but an
odious combination of Rebels, the proclamation is most
unequal in operation; for it begins by a solemn investiture
of Rebels with all the rights of war, saying to them,
as was once said to the youthful knight, “Rise; here is
a sword; use it.” To call such an investiture a proclamation
of neutrality is a misnomer. It was a proclamation
of equality between the National Government on
the one side and Rebels on the other, and no plausible
word can obscure this distinctive character.</p>

<p>Then came the building of the pirate ships, one after
another. While the Alabama was still in the ship-yard,
it became apparent that she was intended for the Rebels.
Our Minister at London and our Consul at Liverpool
exerted themselves for her arrest and detention. They
were put off from day to day. On the 24th July, 1862,
Mr. Adams “completed his evidence,” accompanied by
an opinion from the eminent barrister, Mr. Collier, afterward
Solicitor-General, declaring the plain duty of
the British Government to stop her.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Instead of acting
promptly by the telegraph, five days were allowed
to run out, when at last, too tardily, the necessary order
was dispatched. Meanwhile the pirate ship escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
from the port of Liverpool by a stratagem, and her voyage
began with music and frolic. Here, beyond all
question, was negligence, or, according to the language
of Lord Brougham on another occasion, “crass negligence,”
making England justly responsible for all that
ensued.</p>

<p>The pirate ship found refuge in an obscure harbor of
Wales, known as Moelfra Bay, where she lay in British
waters <i>from half-past seven o’clock, P. M., July 29th, to
about three o’clock, A. M., July 31st</i>, being upward of
thirty-one hours, and during this time she was supplied
with men from the British steam-tug Hercules, which
followed her from Liverpool. These thirty-one hours
were allowed to elapse without any attempt to stop her.
Here was another stage of “crass negligence.”</p>

<p>Thus was there negligence in allowing the building to
proceed, negligence in allowing the escape from Liverpool,
and negligence in allowing the final escape from
the British coast.</p>

<p>Lord Russell, while trying to vindicate his Government,
and repelling the complaints of the United States,
more than once admitted that the escape of the Alabama
was “a scandal and a reproach,”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> which to my mind is
very like a confession. Language could not be stronger.
Surely such an act cannot be blameless. If damages are
ever awarded to a friendly power for injuries received, it
is difficult to see where they could be more strenuously
claimed than in a case which the First Minister of the
offending power did not hesitate to characterize so
strongly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The enlistment of the crew was not less obnoxious to
censure than the building of the ship and her escape. It
was a part of the transaction. The evidence is explicit.
Not to occupy too much time, I refer only to the deposition
of William Passmore, who swears that he was engaged
with the express understanding that “the vessel
was going out to the Government of the Confederate
States of America,” “to fight for the Southern Government”;
that he joined her at Laird’s yard at Birkenhead,
near Liverpool, remaining there several weeks;
that there were about thirty men on board, most of them
old man-of-war’s men, among whom it was “well known
that the vessel was going out as a privateer for the Confederate
Government, to act against the United States,
under a commission from Mr. Jefferson Davis.”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In a
list of the crew, now before me, there is a large number
said to be from the “Royal Naval Reserve.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> I might
add to this testimony. The more the case is examined,
the more clearly do we discern the character of the transaction.</p>

<p>The dedication of the ship to the Rebel service, from
the very laying of the keel and the organization of her
voyage, with England as her <i>naval base</i>, from which she
drew munitions of war and men, made her departure as
much <i>a hostile expedition</i> as if she had sailed forth from
her Majesty’s dock-yard. At a moment of profound peace
between the United States and England there was a hostile
expedition against the United States. It was in no
just sense a commercial transaction, but an act of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is not yet complete. The Alabama, whose
building was in defiance of law, international and municipal,
whose escape was “a scandal and a reproach,” and
whose enlistment of her crew was a fit sequel to the rest,
after being supplied with an armament and with a Rebel
commander, entered upon her career of piracy. Mark
now a new stage of complicity. Constantly the pirate
ship was within reach of British cruisers, and from time
to time within the shelter of British ports. For five
days, unmolested, she enjoyed the pleasant hospitality
of Kingston, in Jamaica, obtaining freely the coal and
other supplies so necessary to her vocation. But no
British cruiser, no British magistrate ever arrested the
offending ship, whose voyage was a continuing “scandal
and reproach” to the British Government.</p>

<p>The excuse for this strange license is a curious technicality,&mdash;as
if a technicality could avail in this case at
any stage. Borrowing a phrase from that master of admiralty
jurisprudence, Sir William Scott, it is said that
the ship “deposited” her original sin at the conclusion
of her voyage, so that afterward she was blameless. But
the Alabama never concluded her voyage until she sank
under the guns of the Kearsarge, because she never had
a port of her own. She was no better than the Flying
Dutchman, and so long as she sailed was liable for that
original sin, which had impregnated every plank with
an indelible dye. No British cruiser could allow her to
proceed, no British port could give her shelter, without
renewing the complicity of England.</p>

<p>The Alabama case begins with a fatal concession, by
which the Rebels were enabled to build ships in England,
and then to sail them, without being liable as
pirates; it next shows itself in the building of the ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in the armament, and in the escape, with so much of
negligence on the part of the British Government as to
constitute sufferance, if not connivance; and then, again,
the case reappears in the welcome and hospitality accorded
by British cruisers and by the magistrates of
British ports to the pirate ship, when her evasion from
British jurisdiction was well known. Thus at three different
stages the British Government is compromised:
first, in the concession of ocean belligerency, on which
all depended; secondly, in the negligence which allowed
the evasion of the ship, in order to enter upon the hostile
expedition for which she was built, manned, armed,
and equipped; and, thirdly, in the open complicity
which, after this evasion, gave her welcome, hospitality,
and supplies in British ports. Thus her depredations
and burnings, making the ocean blaze, all proceeded
from England, which by three different acts lighted the
torch. To England must be traced, also, all the wide-spread
consequences which ensued.</p>

<p>I take the case of the Alabama because it is the best
known, and because the building, equipment, and escape
of this ship were under circumstances most obnoxious to
judgment; but it will not be forgotten that there were
consort ships, built under the shelter of that fatal Proclamation,
issued in such an eclipse of just principles,
and, like the ships it unloosed, “rigged with curses
dark.” One after another, ships were built; one after
another, they escaped on their errand; and, one after
another, they enjoyed the immunities of British ports.
Audacity reached its height when iron-clad rams were
built, and the perversity of the British Government became
still more conspicuous by its long refusal to arrest
these destructive engines of war, destined to be employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
against the United States. This protracted hesitation,
where the consequences were so menacing, is a part of
the case.</p>

<p>It is plain that the ships which were built under the
safeguard of this ill-omened Proclamation, which stole
forth from the British shores and afterward enjoyed the
immunities of British ports, were not only British in
origin, but British in equipment, British in armament,
and British in crews. They were British in every respect,
except in their commanders, who were Rebel; and
one of these, as his ship was sinking, owed his safety to
a British yacht, symbolizing the omnipresent support of
England. British sympathies were active in their behalf.
The cheers of a British passenger-ship crossing
the path of the Alabama encouraged the work of piracy;
and the cheers of the House of Commons encouraged
the builder of the Alabama, while he defended what he
had done, and exclaimed, in taunt to him who is now an
illustrious member of the British Cabinet, John Bright,
that he “would rather be handed down to posterity as
the builder of a dozen Alabamas” than be the author of
the speeches of that gentleman “crying up” the institutions
of the United States, which the builder of the
Alabama, rising with his theme, denounced as “of no
value whatever,” and as “reducing the very name of
Liberty to an utter absurdity,”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> while the cheers of the
House of Commons echoed back his words. Thus from
beginning to end, from the fatal Proclamation to the rejoicing
of the accidental ship and the rejoicing of the
House of Commons, was this hostile expedition protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and encouraged by England. The same spirit which
dictated the swift concession of belligerency, with all
its deadly incidents, ruled the hour, entering into and
possessing every pirate ship.</p>

<p>There are two circumstances by which the whole case
is aggravated. One is found in the date of the Proclamation
which lifted the Rebels to an equality with the
National Government, opening to them everything that
was open to us, whether ship-yards, foundries, or manufactories,
and giving to them a flag on the ocean coëqual
with the flag of the Union. This extraordinary manifesto
was signed on the very day of the arrival of our
Minister in England,&mdash;so that, when, after an ocean
voyage, he reached the British Government, to which he
was accredited, he found this great and terrible indignity
to his country already perpetrated, and the floodgates
opened to infinite woes. The Minister had been
announced; he was daily expected; the British Government
knew of his coming;&mdash;but in hottest haste
they did this thing.</p>

<p>The other aggravation is found in its flagrant, unnatural
departure from that Antislavery rule which,
by manifold declarations, legislative, political, and diplomatic,
was the avowed creed of England. Often was
this rule proclaimed, but, if we except the great Act of
Emancipation, never more pointedly than in the famous
circular of Lord Palmerston, while Minister of Foreign
Affairs, announcing to all nations that England was
pledged to the Universal Abolition of Slavery.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
now, when Slaveholders, in the very madness of barbarism,
broke away from the National Government and
attempted to found a new empire with Slavery as its
declared corner-stone, Antislavery England, without a
day’s delay, without even waiting the arrival of our
Minister at the seat of Government, although known
to be on his way, made haste to decree that this shameful
and impossible pretension should enjoy equal rights
with the National Government in her ship-yards, foundries,
and manufactories, and equal rights on the ocean.
Such was the decree. Rebel Slaveholders, occupied in
a hideous attempt, were taken by the hand, and thus,
with the official protection and the God-speed of Antislavery
England, commenced their accursed work.</p>

<p>I close this part of the argument with the testimony
of Mr. Bright, who, in a speech at Rochdale, among his
neighbors, February 3, 1863, thus exhibits the criminal
complicity of England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I regret, more than I have words to express, this painful
fact, that, of all the countries in Europe, this country is the
only one which has men in it who are willing to take active
steps in favor of this intended Slave Government. We supply
the ships; we supply the arms, the munitions of war;
<i>we give aid and comfort to this foulest of all crimes. Englishmen
only do it.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In further illustration, and in support of Mr. Bright’s
allegation, I refer again to the multitudinous blockade-runners
from England. Without the manifesto of belligerency
they could not have sailed. All this stealthy
fleet, charged with hostility to the United States, was a
part of the great offence. The blockade-runners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
kindred to the pirate ships. They were of the same bad
family, having their origin and home in England. From
the beginning they went forth with their cargoes of
death;&mdash;for the supplies which they furnished contributed
to the work of death. When, after a long and
painful siege, our conquering troops entered Vicksburg,
they found Armstrong guns from England in position;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and so on every field where our patriot fellow-citizens
breathed a last breath were English arms and munitions
of war, all testifying against England. The dead spoke,
also,&mdash;and the wounded still speak.</p>

<h3>REPARATION FROM ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>At last the Rebellion succumbed. British ships and
British supplies had done their work, but they failed.
And now the day of reckoning has come,&mdash;but with
little apparent sense of what is due on the part of England.
Without one soothing word for a friendly power
deeply aggrieved, without a single regret for what Mr.
Cobden, in the House of Commons, called “the cruel
losses”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> inflicted upon us, or for what Mr. Bright called
“aid and comfort to the foulest of all crimes,”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or for
what a generous voice from Oxford University denounced
as a “flagrant and maddening wrong,”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> England simply
proposes to submit the question of liability for individual
losses to an anomalous tribunal where chance plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
its part. This is all. Nothing is admitted, even on this
question; no rule for the future is established; while
nothing is said of the indignity to the nation, nor of the
damages to the nation. On an earlier occasion it was
otherwise.</p>

<p>There is an unhappy incident in our relations with
Great Britain, which attests how in other days individual
losses were only a minor element in reparation for
a wrong received by the nation. You all know from
history how in time of profound peace, and only a few
miles outside the Virginia Capes, the British frigate
Leopard fired into the national frigate Chesapeake, pouring
broadside upon broadside, killing three persons and
wounding eighteen, some severely, and then, boarding
her, carried off four others as British subjects. This was
in the summer of 1807. The brilliant Mr. Canning, British
Minister of Foreign Affairs, promptly volunteered
overtures for an accommodation, by declaring his Majesty’s
readiness to take the whole of the circumstances
of the case into consideration, and “to make reparation
for <i>any alleged injury to the sovereignty of the United
States</i>, whenever it should be clearly shown that such
injury has been actually sustained and that such reparation
is really due.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Here was a good beginning. There
was to be reparation for an injury to the national sovereignty.
After years of painful negotiation, the British
Minister at Washington, under date of November
1, 1811, offered to the United States three propositions:
first, the disavowal of the unauthorized act; secondly,
the immediate restoration, so far as circumstances would
permit, of the men forcibly taken from the Chesapeake;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and, thirdly, a suitable pecuniary provision for the sufferers
in consequence of the attack on the Chesapeake;
concluding with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These honorable propositions are made with the sincere
desire that they may prove satisfactory to the Government of
the United States, and I trust they will meet with that amicable
reception which their conciliatory nature entitles them
to. I need scarcely add how cordially I join with you in the
wish that they might prove introductory to a removal of all
the differences depending between our two countries.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I adduce this historic instance to illustrate partly the
different forms of reparation. Here, of course, was reparation
to individuals; but there was also reparation to
the nation, whose sovereignty had been outraged.</p>

<p>There is another instance, which is not without authority.
In 1837 an armed force from Upper Canada
crossed the river just above the Falls of Niagara, and
burned an American vessel, the Caroline, while moored
to the shores of the United States. Mr. Webster, in his
negotiation with Lord Ashburton, characterized this act
as “of itself a wrong, and an offence to the sovereignty
and the dignity of the United States, … for which,
to this day, no atonement, or even apology, has been
made by her Majesty’s Government,”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;all these words
being strictly applicable to the present case. Lord Ashburton,
in reply, after recapitulating some mitigating
circumstances, and expressing a regret “that some explanation
and apology for this occurrence was not immediately
made,” proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Her Majesty’s Government earnestly desire that a reciprocal
respect for the independent jurisdiction and authority of
neighboring states may be considered among the first duties
of all Governments; and I have to repeat the assurance of
regret they feel that the event of which I am treating should
have disturbed the harmony they so anxiously wish to maintain
with the American people and Government.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again was reparation for a wrong done to the
nation.</p>

<p>Looking at what is due to us on the present occasion,
we are brought again to the conclusion that the satisfaction
of individuals whose ships have been burnt or sunk
is only a small part of what we may justly expect. As
in the earlier cases where the national sovereignty was
insulted, there should be an acknowledgment of wrong,
or at least of liability, leaving to the commissioners the
assessment of damages only. The blow inflicted by that
fatal Proclamation which insulted our national sovereignty
and struck at our unity as a nation, followed by
broadside upon broadside, driving our commerce from
the ocean, was kindred in character to those earlier
blows; and when we consider that it was in aid of
Slavery, it was a blow at Civilization itself. Besides
degrading us and ruining our commerce, its direct and
constant influence was to encourage the Rebellion, and
to prolong the war waged by Slaveholders at such cost
of treasure and blood. It was a terrible mistake,
which I cannot doubt that good Englishmen must regret.
And now, in the interest of peace, it is the duty of both
sides to find a remedy, complete, just, and conciliatory,
so that the deep sense of wrong and the detriment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the Republic may be forgotten in that proper satisfaction
which a nation loving justice cannot hesitate to
offer.</p>

<h3>THE EXTENT OF OUR LOSSES.</h3>

<p><i>Individual losses</i> may be estimated with reasonable
accuracy. Ships burnt or sunk with their cargoes may
be counted, and their value determined; but this leaves
without recognition the vaster damage to commerce
driven from the ocean, and that other damage, immense
and infinite, caused by the prolongation of the war, all
of which may be called <i>national</i> in contradistinction
to <i>individual</i>.</p>

<p>Our <i>national losses</i> have been frankly conceded by
eminent Englishmen. I have already quoted Mr. Cobden,
who did not hesitate to call them “cruel losses.”
During the same debate in which he let drop this testimony,
he used other words, which show how justly he
comprehended the case. “<i>You have been</i>,” said he,
“<i>carrying on hostilities from these shores against the
people of the United States</i>, and have been inflicting an
amount of damage on that country greater than would
be produced by many ordinary wars. It is estimated
that the loss sustained by the capture and burning of
American vessels has been about $15,000,000, or nearly
£3,000,000 sterling. <i>But that is a small part of the injury
which has been inflicted on the American marine.</i>
We have rendered the rest of her vast mercantile property
for the present valueless.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus, by the testimony
of Mr. Cobden, were those individual losses which are
alone recognized by the pending treaty only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> “a small
part of the injury inflicted.” After confessing his fears
with regard to “the heaping up of a <i>gigantic material
grievance</i>” such as was then accumulating, he adds, in
memorable words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have already done your worst towards the American
mercantile marine. What with the high rate of insurance,
what with these captures, and what with the rapid transfer
of tonnage to British capitalists, you have virtually made
valueless that vast property. Why, if you had gone and
helped the Confederates by bombarding all the accessible
seaport towns of America, a few lives might have been lost,
which, as it is, have not been sacrificed; but you could
hardly have done more injury in the way of destroying property
than you have done by these few cruisers.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With that clearness of vision which he possessed in
such rare degree, this statesman saw that England had
“virtually made valueless a vast property,” as much as
if this power had “bombarded all the accessible seaport
towns of America.”</p>

<p>So strong and complete is this statement, that any
further citation seems superfluous; but I cannot forbear
adducing a pointed remark in the same debate, by that
able gentleman, Mr. William E. Forster:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There could not,” said he, “be a stronger illustration of
the damage which had been done to the American trade by
these cruisers than the fact, that, so completely was the American
flag driven from the ocean, the Georgia, on her second
cruise, did not meet a single American vessel in six weeks,
though she saw no less than seventy vessels in a very few
days.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>This is most suggestive. So entirely was our commerce
driven from the ocean, that for six weeks not an
American vessel was seen!</p>

<p>Another Englishman, in an elaborate pamphlet, bears
similar testimony. I refer to the pamphlet of Mr. Edge,
published in London by Ridgway in 1863, and entitled
“The Destruction of the American Carrying-Trade.”
After setting forth at length the destruction of our commerce
by British pirates, this writer thus foreshadows
the damages:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Were we,” says he, “the sufferers, we should certainly
demand compensation for the loss of the property captured
or destroyed, for the interest of the capital invested in the
vessels and their cargoes, and, maybe, a fair compensation in
addition for all and any injury accruing to our business interests
from the depredations upon our shipping. <i>The remuneration
may reach a high figure in the present case; but it
would be a simple act of justice</i>, and might prevent an incomparably
greater loss in the future.”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here we have the damages assessed by an Englishman,
who, while contemplating remuneration at a high
figure, recognizes it as “a simple act of justice.”</p>

<p>Such is the candid and explicit testimony of Englishmen,
pointing the way to the proper rule of damages.
How to authenticate the extent of national loss with
reasonable certainty is not without difficulty; but it
cannot be doubted that such a loss occurred. It is folly
to question it. The loss may be seen in various circumstances:
as, in the rise of insurance on all American
vessels; the fate of the carrying-trade, which was one of
the great resources of our country; the diminution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
our tonnage, with the corresponding increase of British
tonnage; the falling off in our exports and imports, with
due allowance for our abnormal currency and the diversion
of war. These are some of the elements; and here
again we have British testimony. Mr. W. E. Forster, in
the speech already quoted, announces that “the carrying-trade
of the United States was transferred to British
merchants”;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and Mr. Cobden, with his characteristic
mastery of details, shows, that, according to an official
document laid on the table of Parliament, American
shipping had been transferred to English capitalists as
follows: in 1858, 33 vessels, 12,684 tons; 1859, 49 vessels,
21,308 tons; 1860, 41 vessels, 13,638 tons; 1861,
126 vessels, 71,673 tons; 1862, 135 vessels, 64,578 tons;
and 1863, 348 vessels, 252,579 tons; and he adds, “I
am told that this operation is now going on as fast as
ever”; and this circumstance he declares to be “the
<i>most serious aspect</i> of the question of our relations with
America.”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> But this “most serious aspect” is left untouched
by the pending treaty.</p>

<p>Our own official documents are in harmony with these
English authorities. For instance, I have before me now
the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1868,
with an appendix by Mr. Nimmo, on shipbuilding in
our country. From this Report it appears that in the
New England States, during the year 1855, the most
prosperous year of American shipbuilding, 305 ships
and barks and 173 schooners were built, with an aggregate
tonnage of 326,429 tons, while during the last year
only 58 ships and barks and 213 schooners were built,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with an aggregate tonnage of 98,697 tons.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I add a
further statement from the same Report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the ten years from 1852 to 1862 the aggregate
tonnage of American vessels entered at seaports of the United
States from foreign countries was 30,225,475 tons, and the
aggregate tonnage of foreign vessels entered was 14,699,192
tons, while during the five years from 1863 to 1868 the aggregate
tonnage of American vessels entered was 9,299,877
tons, and the aggregate tonnage of foreign vessels entered was
14,116,427 tons,&mdash;showing that American tonnage in our
foreign trade had fallen from two hundred and five to sixty-six
per cent. of foreign tonnage in the same trade. Stated in
other terms, during the decade from 1852 to 1862 sixty-seven
per cent. of the total tonnage entered from foreign countries
was in American vessels, and during the five years from 1863
to 1868 only thirty-nine per cent. of the aggregate tonnage
entered from foreign countries was in American vessels,&mdash;a
relative falling off of nearly one half.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not easy to say how much of this change, which
has become chronic, may be referred to British pirates;
but it cannot be doubted that they contributed largely
to produce it. They began the influences under which
this change has continued.</p>

<p>There is another document which bears directly upon
the present question. I refer to the interesting Report
of Mr. Morse, our consul at London, made during the
last year, and published by the Secretary of State.
After a minute inquiry, the Report shows that on the
breaking out of the Rebellion in 1861 the entire tonnage
of the United States, coasting and registered, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
5,539,813 tons, of which 2,642,628 tons were registered
and employed in foreign trade, and that at the close of
the Rebellion in 1865, notwithstanding an increase in
coasting tonnage, our registered tonnage had fallen to
1,602,528 tons, being a loss during the four years of
more than a million tons, amounting to about forty per
cent. of our foreign commerce. During the same four
years the total tonnage of the British empire rose from
5,895,369 tons to 7,322,604 tons, the increase being especially
in the foreign trade. The Report proceeds to
say that as to the cause of the decrease in America and
the corresponding increase in the British empire “there
can be no room for question or doubt.” Here is the precise
testimony from one who at his official post in London
watched this unprecedented drama, with the outstretched
ocean as a theatre, and British pirates as the
performers:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Conceding to the Rebels the belligerent rights of the sea,
when they had not a solitary war-ship afloat, in dock, or in
the process of construction, and when they had no power to
protect or dispose of prizes, made their sea-rovers, when they
appeared, the instruments of terror and destruction to our
commerce. From the appearance of the first corsair in pursuit
of their ships, American merchants had to pay not only
the marine, but the war risk also, on their ships. After the
burning of one or two ships with their neutral cargoes, the
ship-owner had to pay the war risk on the cargo his ship had
on freight, as well as on the ship. Even then, for safety, the
preference was, as a matter of course, always given to neutral
vessels, and American ships could rarely find employment on
these hard terms as long as there were good neutral ships in
the freight markets. Under such circumstances there was no
course left for our merchant ship-owners but to take such
profitless business as was occasionally offered them, let their
ships lie idle at their moorings or in dock with large expense
and deterioration constantly going on, to sell them outright
when they could do so without ruinous sacrifice, or put them
under foreign flags for protection.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Beyond the actual loss in the national tonnage, there
was a further loss in the arrest of our natural increase
in this branch of industry, which an intelligent statistician
puts at five per cent. annually, making in 1866 a
total loss on this account of 1,384,953 tons, which must
be added to 1,229,035 tons actually lost.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The same statistician,
after estimating the value of a ton at forty dollars
gold, and making allowance for old and new ships,
puts the sum-total of national loss on this account at
$110,000,000. Of course this is only an item in our
bill.</p>

<p>To these authorities I add that of the National Board
of Trade, which, in a recent report on American Shipping,
after setting forth the diminution of our sailing
tonnage, says that it is nearly all to be traced to the war
on the ocean; and the result is summed up in the words,
that, “while the tonnage of the nation was rapidly disappearing
<i>by the ravages of the Rebel cruisers</i> and by sales
abroad, in addition to the usual loss by the perils of the
sea, there was no construction of new vessels going forward
to counteract the decline even in part.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Such is
the various testimony, all tending to one conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>This is what I have to say for the present on <i>national
losses</i> through the destruction of commerce. These are
large enough; but there is another chapter, where they
are larger far: I refer, of course, to the national losses
caused by the prolongation of the war, and traceable directly
to England. Pardon me, if I confess the regret
with which I touch this prodigious item; for I know
well the depth of feeling which it is calculated to stir.
But I cannot hesitate. It belongs to the case. No candid
person, who studies this eventful period, can doubt
that the Rebellion was originally encouraged by hope of
support from England,&mdash;that it was strengthened at
once by the concession of belligerent rights on the ocean,&mdash;that
it was fed to the end by British supplies,&mdash;that
it was encouraged by every well-stored British ship that
was able to defy our blockade,&mdash;that it was quickened
into frantic life with every report from the British pirates,
flaming anew with every burning ship; nor can it
be doubted that without British intervention the Rebellion
would have soon succumbed under the well-directed
efforts of the National Government. Not weeks or
months, but years, were added in this way to our war,
so full of costly sacrifice. The subsidies which in other
times England contributed to Continental wars were less
effective than the aid and comfort which she contributed
to the Rebellion. It cannot be said too often that the
<i>naval base</i> of the Rebellion was not in America, but in
England. The blockade-runners and the pirate ships
were all English. England was the fruitful parent, and
these were the “hell-hounds,” pictured by Milton in his
description of Sin, which, “when they list, would creep
into her womb and kennel there.” Mr. Cobden boldly
said in the House of Commons that England made war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
from her shores on the United States, with “an amount
of damage to that country greater than would be produced
by many ordinary wars.”<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> According to this testimony,
the conduct of England was war; but it must
not be forgotten that this war was carried on at our sole
cost. The United States paid for a war waged by England
upon the National Unity.</p>

<p>There was one form that this war assumed which was
incessant, most vexatious, and costly, besides being in
itself a positive alliance with the Rebellion. It was that
of blockade-runners, openly equipped and supplied by
England under the shelter of that baleful Proclamation.
Constantly leaving English ports, they stole across the
ocean, and then broke the blockade. These active
agents of the Rebellion could be counteracted only by a
network of vessels stretching along the coast, at great
cost to the country. Here is another distinct item, the
amount of which may be determined at the Navy Department.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of precious life is beyond human compensation;
but there may be an approximate estimate
of the national loss in treasure. Everybody can make
the calculation. I content myself with calling attention
to the elements which enter into it. Besides the blockade,
there was the prolongation of the war. The Rebellion
was suppressed at a cost of more than four thousand
million dollars, a considerable portion of which has been
already paid, leaving twenty-five hundred millions as a
national debt to burden the people. If, through British
intervention, the war was doubled in duration, or in any
way extended, as cannot be doubted, then is England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
justly responsible for the additional expenditure to which
our country was doomed; and whatever may be the final
settlement of these great accounts, such must be the
judgment in any chancery which consults the simple
equity of the case.</p>

<p>This plain statement, without one word of exaggeration
or aggravation, is enough to exhibit the magnitude
of the national losses, whether from the destruction of
our commerce, the prolongation of the war, or the expense
of the blockade. They stand before us mountain-high,
with a base broad as the Nation, and a mass stupendous
as the Rebellion itself. It will be for a wise
statesmanship to determine how this fearful accumulation,
like Ossa upon Pelion, shall be removed out of
sight, so that it shall no longer overshadow the two
countries.</p>

<h3>THE RULE OF DAMAGES.</h3>

<p>Perhaps I ought to anticipate an objection from the
other side, to the effect that these national losses, whether
from the destruction of our commerce, the prolongation
of the war, or the expense of the blockade, are indirect
and remote, so as not to be a just ground of claim. This
is expressed at the Common Law by the rule that “damages
must be for the natural and proximate consequence
of an act.”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> To this excuse the answer is explicit. The
damages suffered by the United States are twofold, individual
and national, being in each case direct and proximate,
although in the one case individuals suffered, and
in the other case the nation. It is easy to see that there
may be occasions, where, overtopping all individual
damages, are damages suffered by the nation, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
reparation to individuals would be insufficient. Nor
can the claim of the nation be questioned simply because
it is large, or because the evidence with regard to
it is different from that in the case of an individual. In
each case the damage must be proved by the best possible
evidence, and this is all that law or reason can
require. In the case of the nation the evidence is historic;
and this is enough. Impartial history will record
the national losses from British intervention, and it is
only reasonable that the evidence of these losses should
not be excluded from judgment. Because the case is
without precedent, because no nation ever before received
such injury from a friendly power, this can be
no reason why the question should not be considered on
the evidence.</p>

<p>Even the rule of the Common Law furnishes no impediment;
for our damages are the natural consequence
of what was done. But the rule of the Roman Law,
which is the rule of International Law, is broader than
that of the Common Law. The measure of damages,
according to the Digest, is, “Whatever may have been
lost or might have been gained,”&mdash;<i>Quantum mihi abest,
quantumque lucrari potui</i>;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and this same rule seems to
prevail in the French Law, borrowed from the Roman
Law.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This rule opens the door to ample reparation for
all damages, whether individual or national.</p>

<p>There is another rule of the Common Law, in harmony
with strict justice, which is applicable in the
case. I find it in the law relating to <i>Nuisances</i>, which
provides that there may be two distinct proceedings,&mdash;first,
in behalf of individuals, and, secondly, in behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the community. Obviously, reparation to individuals
does not supersede reparation to the community.
The proceeding in the one case is by action at law,
and in the other by indictment. The reason assigned
by Blackstone for the latter is, “Because, the damage
being common to all the king’s subjects, no one can
assign his particular proportion of it.”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> But this is
the very case with regard to damages sustained by the
nation.</p>

<p>A familiar authority furnishes an additional illustration,
which is precisely in point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No person, natural or corporate, can have an action for a
<i>public nuisance</i>, or punish it,&mdash;but only the king, in his public
capacity of supreme governor and <i>paterfamilias</i> of the
kingdom. Yet this rule admits of one exception: where a
private person suffers some extraordinary damage beyond the
rest of the king’s subjects.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Applying this rule to the present case, the way is
clear. Every British pirate was <i>a public nuisance</i>, involving
the British Government, which must respond in
damages, not only to the individuals who have suffered,
but also to the National Government, acting as <i>paterfamilias</i>
for the common good of all the people.</p>

<p>Thus by an analogy of the Common Law in the case
of a Public Nuisance, also by the strict rule of the
Roman Law, which enters so largely into International
Law, and even by the rule of the Common Law relating
to Damages, all losses, whether individual or national,
are the just subject of claim. It is not I who say this;
it is the Law. The colossal sum-total may be seen not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
only in the losses of individuals, but in those national
losses caused by the destruction of our commerce, the
prolongation of the war, and the expense of the blockade,
all of which may be charged directly to England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Corpore, et ex una pendebat origine bellum.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Three times is this liability fixed: first, by the concession
of ocean belligerency, opening to the Rebels ship-yards,
foundries, and manufactories, and giving to them
a flag on the ocean; secondly, by the organization of
hostile expeditions, which, by admissions in Parliament,
were nothing less than piratical war on the United States
with England as the naval base; and, thirdly, by welcome,
hospitality, and supplies extended to these pirate
ships in ports of the British empire. Show either of
these, and the liability of England is complete; show
the three, and this power is bound by a triple cord.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>, in concluding these remarks, I desire
to say that I am no volunteer. For several years I have
carefully avoided saying anything on this most irritating
question, being anxious that negotiations should be left
undisturbed to secure a settlement which could be accepted
by a deeply injured nation. The submission of
the pending treaty to the judgment of the Senate left
me no alternative. It became my duty to consider it
carefully in committee, and to review the whole subject.
If I failed to find what we had a right to expect, and if
the just claims of our country assumed unexpected proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
it was not because I would bear hard on England,
but because I wish most sincerely to remove all
possibility of strife between our two countries; and it
is evident that this can be done only by first ascertaining
the nature and extent of difference. In this spirit
I have spoken to-day. If the case against England is
strong, and if our claims are unprecedented in magnitude,
it is only because the conduct of this power at a
trying period was most unfriendly, and the injurious
consequences of this conduct were on a scale corresponding
to the theatre of action. Life and property were
both swallowed up, leaving behind a deep-seated sense
of enormous wrong, as yet unatoned and even unacknowledged,
which is one of the chief factors in the
problem now presented to the statesmen of both countries.
The attempt to close this great international
debate without a complete settlement is little short of
puerile.</p>

<p>With the lapse of time and with minuter consideration
the case against England becomes more grave, not
only from the questions of international responsibility
which it involves, but from better comprehension of the
damages, which are seen now in their true proportions.
During the war, and for some time thereafter, it was
impossible to state them. The mass of a mountain
cannot be measured at its base; the observer must occupy
a certain distance; and this rule of perspective
is justly applicable to damages which are vast beyond
precedent.</p>

<p>A few dates will show the progress of the controversy,
and how the case enlarged. Going as far back as
20th November, 1862, we find our Minister in London,
Mr. Adams, calling for redress from the British Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
on account of the Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This was the
mild beginning. On the 23d October, 1863, in another
communication, the same Minister suggested to the
British Government any “fair and equitable form of
conventional arbitrament or reference.”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This proposition
slumbered in the British Foreign Office for nearly
two years, during which the Alabama was pursuing her
piratical career, when, on the 30th August, 1865, it was
awakened by Lord Russell only to be knocked down in
these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In your letter of the 23d of October, 1863, you were
pleased to say that the Government of the United States is
ready to agree to any form of arbitration.… Her Majesty’s
Government must, therefore, decline either to make reparation
and compensation for the captures made by the Alabama, or
to refer the question to any foreign state.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was our repulse from England, having at least
the merit of frankness, if nothing else. On the 17th
October, 1865, our Minister informed Lord Russell that
the United States had finally resolved to make no effort
for arbitration.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Again the whole question slumbered
until 27th August, 1866, when Mr. Seward presented a
list of individual claims on account of the pirate Alabama
and other Rebel cruisers.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> From that time negotiation
has continued, with ups and downs, until at last
the pending treaty was signed. Had the early overtures
of our Government been promptly accepted, or had there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
been at any time a just recognition of the wrong done,
I doubt not that this great question would have been
settled; but the rejection of our very moderate propositions,
and the protracted delay, which afforded an opportunity
to review the case in its different bearings, have
awakened the people to the magnitude of the interests
involved. If our demands are larger now than at our
first call, it is not the only time in history when such a
rise has occurred. The story of the Sibyl is repeated,
and England is the Roman king.</p>

<p>Shall these claims be liquidated and cancelled promptly,
or allowed to slumber until called into activity by
some future exigency? There are many among us, who,
taking counsel of a sense of national wrong, would leave
them to rest without settlement, so as to furnish a precedent
for retaliation in kind, should England find herself
at war. There are many in England, who, taking
counsel of a perverse political bigotry, have spurned
them absolutely; and there are others, who, invoking
the point of honor, assert that England cannot entertain
them without compromising her honor. Thus there is
peril from both sides. It is not difficult to imagine one
of our countrymen saying, with Shakespeare’s Jew,
“The villany you teach me I will execute, and it shall
go hard but I will better the instruction”; nor is it difficult
to imagine an Englishman firm in his conceit that
no apology can be made and nothing paid. I cannot
sympathize with either side. Be the claims more or
less, they are honestly presented, with the conviction
that they are just; and they should be considered candidly,
so that they shall no longer lower, like a cloud
ready to burst, upon two nations, which, according to
their inclinations, can do each other such infinite injury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
or such infinite good. I know it is sometimes said that
war between us must come sooner or later. I do not
believe it. But if it must come, let it be later, and then
I am sure it will never come. Meanwhile good men
must unite to make it impossible.</p>

<p>Again I say, this debate is not of my seeking. It is
not tempting; for it compels criticism of a foreign power
with which I would have more than peace, more even
than concord. But it cannot be avoided. The truth
must be told,&mdash;not in anger, but in sadness. England
has done to the United States an injury most difficult to
measure. Considering when it was done and in what
complicity, it is truly unaccountable. At a great epoch
of history, not less momentous than that of the French
Revolution or that of the Reformation, when Civilization
was fighting a last battle with Slavery, England gave her
name, her influence, her material resources to the wicked
cause, and flung a sword into the scale with Slavery.
Here was a portentous mistake. Strange that the land
of Wilberforce, after spending millions for Emancipation,
after proclaiming everywhere the truths of Liberty,
and ascending to glorious primacy in the sublime movement
for the Universal Abolition of Slavery, could do
this thing! Like every departure from the rule of justice
and good neighborhood, her conduct was pernicious
in proportion to the scale of operations, affecting individuals,
corporations, communities, and the nation itself.
And yet down to this day there is no acknowledgment
of this wrong,&mdash;not a single word. Such a generous
expression would be the beginning of a just settlement,
and the best assurance of that harmony between two
great and kindred nations which all must desire.</p>

<p>The Senate having under consideration a resolution requesting from
the heads of Departments “information of the names, age, and compensation
of all inferior officers, clerks, and employés in their respective
Departments at Washington, showing from what States they were
respectively appointed,” &amp;c., Mr. Abbott, of North Carolina, moved
the following addition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved further</i>, That in the opinion of the Senate the distribution of
the official patronage of the Government not embraced in local offices in
the States should be made as nearly equal among all the States, according
to their representation and population, as may be practicable; and that to
confine such patronage to particular States or sections, either wholly or
partially, is both unjust and injudicious.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the latter resolution Mr. Sumner spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I have rightly read the history
of my country, there was before Vicksburg
an army commanded by three generals from Ohio,&mdash;General
Grant, General Sherman, and General McPherson.
Now, if I rightly understand the proposition of
the Senator from North Carolina, he would require that
the generals in command of our Army should be taken
geographically,&mdash;not according to their merits, not according
to their capacity to defend this Republic and to
maintain with honor its flag, but simply according to
the place of their residence,&mdash;and no three generals
should be in command from one State. Do I understand
the Senator aright?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Abbott.</span> My amendment reads, “as far as practicable.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well,&mdash;“as far as practicable.”
I would inquire of my friend whether fitness for office
or service in other departments of the Government does
not depend upon capacity, talent, preparation, as much
as in the Army? I ask the Senator if it is not so?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Abbott.</span> The purpose of this amendment was not to
override all such considerations; it was to give an expression
of the sense of the Senate that States should not be ignored
in the distribution of this sort of patronage. Nothing in it
prevents three generals from Ohio being in the command of
one army, or the appointment of three Cabinet officers from
Ohio; but it is simply to express the sense of the Senate
that these things ought to be done with something like fairness
and justice, as between the different States.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I take it there is no Senator who does
not accept the general idea of the Senator from North
Carolina, that all things should be done in fairness, and
that all parts of the country, every portion of this great
Republic, should be treated with equal respect and honor.
That is clear. But first and foremost above all is
the public service: that must be maintained; it must
not be sacrificed; and how can it be maintained, unless
you advance to prominent posts in this service those
who are the most meritorious, and who can best discharge
the duties of the post?</p>

<p>I merely throw out this remark, and call attention to
this point, that Senators may see to what this proposition
tends. If it were fully carried out, it would reduce
the public service of this country to one dead
level. Men would go into it merely because they lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
in certain places, not because they had a fitness for the
posts to which they were advanced. Perhaps I am mistaken,
but I see no reason why there should be three
Ohio generals in command before Vicksburg, and not
three Ohio citizens in eminent civil service. To my
mind the attainments and the talents required in civil
service are as well worthy to be recognized as those
that are required in military service, and I see no reason
for a rule that shall allow talent to be taken without
any reference to geographical limit in the military
service which is not equally applicable to the civil service.</p>

<p>Now, as to our friends who have recently come into
this Chamber, I beg them to understand, that, so far
as I am concerned, there is no disposition to deny or
to begrudge them anything to which, according to geographical
proportions, they may be entitled; but I beg
them to consider that time is an essential element of
this transition through which we are passing.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Will my friend allow me to make a
suggestion to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> I merely wish to allude to the notorious
fact that for half a century before the Rebellion the proportion
of persons in civil office in the Departments in Washington
from the Southern States was very nearly, if not quite,
two to one to those from all the other States. They had the
control, and had pretty much all the offices, for years and
years.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> We are now in a process of transition,
and I was observing that time is an essential element
in that process. What the Senator from North Carolina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
aims at cannot be accomplished at once. The
change cannot be made instantly. The men are not
presented from the States lately in rebellion in sufficient
numbers, in sufficient proportion, with competency
for these posts. I know that there are gentlemen
there fit to grace many of these posts, but I know also
that there is not relatively the same proportion of persons
fit for the civil service as there is in the other
parts of the country; and our friends from the South, it
seems to me, must take this into consideration kindly,
and wait yet a little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner was selected as President of the Convention. On taking
the chair he spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of Massachusetts</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">While thanking you for the honor conferred upon
me, I make haste to say that in my judgment
Massachusetts has one duty, at the coming election, to
which all local interests and local questions must be
postponed, as on its just performance all else depends;
and this commanding duty is, to keep the Commonwealth,
now as aforetime, an example to our country
and a bulwark of Human Rights. Such was Massachusetts
in those earlier days, when, on the continent of
Europe, the name of “Bostonians” was given to our
countrymen in arms against the mother country,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> making
this designation embrace all,&mdash;and when, in the
British Parliament, the great orator, Edmund Burke,
exclaimed, “The cause of Boston is become the cause
of all America; every part of America is united in
support of Boston; … you have made Boston the
Lord Mayor of America.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> I quote these words from
the Parliamentary Debates. But Boston was at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
time Massachusetts, and it was her stand for Liberty
that made her name the synonym for all. And permit
me to add, that, in choosing a presiding officer entirely
removed from local issues, I find assurance of
your readiness to unite with me in that <i>National Cause</i>
which concerns not Massachusetts only, but every part
of America, and concerns also our place and name as a
nation.</p>

<p>The enemy here in Massachusetts would be glad to
divert attention from the unassailable principles of the
Republican Party; they would be glad to make you forget
that support we owe to a Republican Administration,&mdash;also
that support we owe to the measures of Reconstruction,
and our constant abiding persistence for
all essential safeguards not yet completely established.
These they would hand over to oblivion, hoping on
some local appeal to disorganize our forces, or, perhaps,
obtain power to be wielded against the National Cause.
Massachusetts cannot afford to occupy an uncertain position.
Therefore I begin by asking you to think of our
country, our whole country,&mdash;in other words, of <i>National
Affairs at Home and Abroad</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now four years since I had the honor of presiding
at our annual Convention, and I do not forget how
at that time I endeavored to remind you of this same
National Cause, then in fearful peril.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The war of armies
was ended; no longer was fellow-citizen arrayed
against fellow-citizen; on each side the trumpet was
hushed, the banner furled. But the defection of Andrew
Johnson had then begun, and out of that defection
the Rebellion assumed new life, with new purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and new hopes. If it did not spring forth once more
fully armed, it did spring forth filled with hate and
diabolism towards all who loved the Union, whether
white or black. There were exceptions, I know; but
they were not enough to change the rule. And straightway
the new apparition, acting in conjunction with the
Northern Democracy, aboriginal allies of the Rebellion,
planned the capture of the National Government. Its
representatives came up to Washington. Then was the
time for a few decisive words in the name of the Republic,
on which for four years they had waged bloody
war. The great dramatist, who has words for every occasion,
anticipated this, when he said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Return thee, therefore, with a flood of tears,</div>
<div class="verse">And wash away thy country’s stained spots.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such a mood would have been the beginning of peace.
How easy to see that these men should have been admonished
frankly and kindly to return home, there to
plant, plough, sow, reap, buy, sell, and be prosperous,
but not to expect any place in the copartnership of
government until there was completest security for all!
Instead of this, they were sent back plotting how to obtain
ascendency at home as the stepping-stone to ascendency
in the nation. Such was the condition of
things in the autumn of 1865, when, sounding the alarm
from this very platform, I insisted upon irreversible
guaranties against the Rebellion, and especially on security
to the national freedman and the national creditor.
It was upon security that I then insisted,&mdash;believing,
that, though the war of armies was ended, this
was a just object of national care, all contained in the
famous time-honored postulate of war, <i>Security for the
Future</i>, without which peace is no better than armistice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>To that security one thing is needed,&mdash;simply this:
All men must be safe in their rights, so that affairs,
whether of government or business, shall have a free
and natural course. But there are two special classes
still in jeopardy, as in the autumn of 1865,&mdash;the National
Freedman and the National Creditor,&mdash;each a
creditor of the nation and entitled to protection, each
under the guardianship of the public faith; and behind
these are faithful Unionists, now suffering terribly from
the growing reaction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the protection of the national freedman a Constitutional
Amendment is presented for ratification, placing
his right to vote under the perpetual safeguard of
the nation; but I am obliged to remind you that this
Amendment has not yet obtained the requisite number
of States, nor can I say surely when it will. The Democratic
Party is arrayed against it, and the Rebel interest
unites with the Democracy. Naturally they go together.
They are old cronies. Here let me say frankly
that I have never ceased to regret,&mdash;I do now most
profoundly regret,&mdash;that Congress, in its plenary powers
under the Constitution, especially in its great unquestionable
power to guaranty a republican government
in the States, did not summarily settle this whole
question, so that it should no longer disturb the country.
It was for Congress to fix the definition of a republican
government; nor need it go further than our
own Declaration of Independence, where is a definition
from which there is no appeal. There it is, as it came
from our fathers, in lofty, self-evident truth; and Congress
should have applied it. Or it might have gone to
the speech of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
again is the same great definition. There was also a
decisive precedent. As Congress made a Civil Rights
Law, so should it have made a Political Rights Law.
In each case the power is identical. If it can be done
in the one, it can be done in the other. To my mind
nothing is clearer. Thus far Congress has thought otherwise.
There remains, then, the slow process of Constitutional
Amendment, to which the country must be
rallied.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But this is not enough. No mere text of Constitution
or Law is sufficient. Behind these must be a
prevailing Public Opinion and a sympathetic Administration.
Both are needed. The Administration must
reinforce Public Opinion, and Public Opinion must
reinforce the Administration. Such is all experience.
Without these the strongest text and most cunning in
its requirements is only a phantom, it may be of terror,
as was the case with the Fugitive Slave Bill,&mdash;but
not a living letter. It is not practically obeyed;
sometimes it is evaded, sometimes openly set at nought.
And now it is my duty to warn you that the national
freedman still needs your care. His ancient master is
already in the field conspiring against him. That traditional
experience, that infinite audacity, that insensibility
to Human Rights, which so long upheld Slavery,
are aroused anew. No longer able to hold him as slave,
the ancient master means to hold him as dependant, and
to keep him in his service, personal and political,&mdash;thus
substituting a new bondage for the old. Unhappily,
he finds at the North a political party which the
Rebellion has not weaned from that unnatural Southern
breast whence it drew its primitive nutriment; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
political party now fraternizes in the dismal work by
which peace is postponed: for until the national freedman
is safe in Equal Rights there can be no peace.
You may call it peace, but I tell you it is not peace.
It is peace only in name. Who does not feel that he
treads still on smothered fires? Who does not feel his
feet burn as he moves over the treacherous ashes? If I
wished any new motive for opposition to the Democracy,
I should find it in this hostile alliance. Because
I am for peace so that this whole people may be at
work, because I desire tranquillity so that all may be
happy, because I seek reconciliation so that there shall
be completest harmony, therefore I oppose the Democracy
and now denounce it as Disturber of the National
Peace.</p>

<p>The information from the South is most painful. Old
Rebels are crawling from hiding-places to resume their
former rule; and what a rule! Such as might be expected
from the representatives of Slavery. It is the
rule of misrule, where the “Ku-Klux-Klan” takes the
place of missionary and schoolmaster. Murder is unloosed.
The national freedman is the victim; and so is
the Unionist. Not one of these States where intimidation,
with death in its train, does not play its part.
Take that whole Southern tier from Georgia to Texas,
and add to it Tennessee, and, I fear, North Carolina and
Virginia also,&mdash;for the crime is contagious,&mdash;and there
is small justice for those to whom you owe so much.
That these things should occur under Andrew Johnson
was natural; that Reconstruction should encounter difficulties
after his defection was natural. Andrew Johnson
is now out of the way, and in his place a patriot
President. Public Opinion must come to his support in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
this necessary work. There is but one thing these disturbers
feel; it is power; and this they must be made
to feel: I mean the power of an awakened people, directed
by a Republican Administration, vigorously, constantly,
surely, so that there shall be no rest for the
wicked.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If I could forget the course of the Democracy on
these things,&mdash;as I cannot,&mdash;there is still another
chapter for exposure; and the more it is seen, the
worse it appears. It is that standing menace of Repudiation,
by which the national credit at home and
abroad suffers so much, and our taxes are so largely increased.
It will not do to say that no National Convention
has yet announced this dishonesty. I charge it
upon the Party. A party which repudiates the fundamental
principles of the Declaration of Independence,
which repudiates Equality before the Law, which repudiates
the self-evident truth that government is founded
only on the consent of the governed, which repudiates
what is most precious and good in our recent history,
and whose chiefs are now engaged in cunning assault
upon the national creditor, is a party of Repudiation.
This is its just designation. A Democrat is a Repudiator.
What is Slavery itself but an enormous wholesale
repudiation of all rights, all truths, and all decencies?
How easy for a party accepting this degradation to repudiate
pecuniary obligations! These are small, compared
with the other. Naturally the Democracy is once
more in conjunction with the old Slave-Masters. The
Repudiation Gospel according to Mr. Pendleton is now
preaching in Ohio; and nothing is more certain than
that the triumph of the Democracy would be a fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
blow not only at the national freedman, but also at
the national creditor. There would be repudiation for
each.</p>

<p>The word “Repudiation,” in its present sense, is not
old. It first appeared in Mississippi, a Democratic
State intensely devoted to Slavery. If the thing were
known before, never before did it assume the same
hardihood of name. It was in 1841 that a Mississippi
Governor, in a Message to the Legislature, used this
word with regard to certain State bonds, and thus began
that policy by which Mississippi was first dishonored
and then kept poor: for capital was naturally shy of
such a State. Constantly, from that time, Mississippi
had this “bad eminence”; nor is the State more known
as the home of Jefferson Davis than as the home of Repudiation.
Unhappily, the nation suffered also; and
even now, as I understand, it is argued in Europe, to
our discredit, that, because Mississippi repudiated, the
nation may repudiate also. If I refer to this example,
it is because I would illustrate the mischief of the
Democratic policy and summon Mississippi to tardy
justice. A regenerated State cannot afford to bear the
burden of Repudiation; nor can the nation and the sisterhood
of States forget misconduct so injurious to all.</p>

<p>I have pleasure, at this point, in reference to an early
effort in the “North American Review,” by an able
lawyer, for a time an ornament of the Supreme Court of
the United States, Hon. B. R. Curtis, who, after reviewing
the misconduct of Mississippi, argues most persuasively,
that, where a State repudiates its obligations, to
the detriment of foreigners, there is a remedy through
the National Government. This suggestion is important
for Mississippi now. But the article contains another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
warning, applicable to the nation at the present hour,
which I quote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The conduct of a few States has not only destroyed their
own credit and left their sister States very little to boast of,
but has so materially affected the credit of the whole Union
that it was found impossible to negotiate in Europe any part
of the loan authorized by Congress in 1842. It was offered
on terms most advantageous to the creditor, terms which
in former times would have been eagerly accepted; and after
going a-begging through all the exchanges of Europe,
the agent gave up the attempt to obtain the money, in
despair.”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As the fallen drunkard illustrates the evils of intemperance,
so does Mississippi illustrate the evils of Repudiation.
Look at her! But there are men who would
degrade our Republic to this wretched condition. Forgetting
what is due to our good name as a nation at
home and abroad,&mdash;forgetting that the public interests
are bound up with the Public Faith, involving all economies,
national and individual,&mdash;forgetting that our
transcendent position has corresponding obligations, and
that, as Nobility once obliged to great duty, (“<i>Noblesse
oblige</i>,”) so does Republicanism now,&mdash;there are men
who, forgetting all these things, would carry our Republic
into this terrible gulf, so full of shame and sacrifice.
They begin by subtle devices; but already the mutterings
of open Repudiation are heard. I denounce them
all, whether device or muttering; and I denounce that
political party which lends itself to the outrage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Repudiation means Confiscation, and in the present
case confiscation of the property of loyal citizens. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
unparalleled generosity the nation has refused to confiscate
Rebel property; and now it is proposed to confiscate
Loyal property. When I expose Repudiation as
Confiscation, I mean to be precise. Between two enactments,
one requiring the surrender of property without
compensation, and the other declaring that the nation
shall not and will not pay an equal amount according
to solemn promise, there can be no just distinction.
The two are alike. The former might alarm a greater
number, because on its face more demonstrative. But
analyze the two, and you will see that in each private
property is taken by the nation without compensation,
and appropriated to its own use. Therefore do I say,
Repudiation is Confiscation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A favorite device of Repudiation is to pay the national
debt in “greenbacks,”&mdash;in other words, to pay
bonds bearing interest with mere promises not bearing
interest,&mdash;violating, in the first place, a rule of honesty,
which forbids such a trick, and, in the second place,
a rule of law, which refuses to recognize an inferior
obligation as payment of a superior. Here, in plain
terms, is repudiation of the interest and indefinite postponement
of the principal. This position, when first
broached, contemplated nothing less than an infinite issue
of greenbacks, flooding the country, as France was
flooded by <i>assignats</i>, and utterly destroying values of all
kinds. Although, in its present more moderate form, it
is limited to payment by existing greenbacks, yet it has
the same radical injustice. Interest-bearing bonds are
to be paid with non-interest-bearing bits of paper. The
statement of the case is enough. Its proposer would
never do this thing in his own affairs; but how can he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
ask his country to do what honesty forbids in private
life?</p>

<p>Another device is to tax the bonds, when the money
was lent on the positive condition that the bonds should
not be taxed. This, of course, is to break the contract
in another way. It is Repudiation in another form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To argue these questions is happily unnecessary, and
I allude to them only because I wish to exhibit the loss
to the country from such attempts. This can be made
plain as a church-door.</p>

<p>The total debt of our country on the 1st September,
aside from the sixty millions of bonds issued to the Pacific
Railway, was $2,475,962,501; and here I mention,
with great satisfaction, that since the 1st March last
the debt has been reduced $49,500,758. The surplus
revenue now accruing is not less than $100,000,000 a
year, and will be, probably, not less than $125,000,000
a year, of which large sum not less than $75,000,000
must be attributed to the better enforcement of the
laws and the economy now prevailing under a Republican
Administration. And here comes the practical
point. Large as is our surplus revenue, it should have
been more, and would have been more but for the Repudiation
menaced by the Democracy.</p>

<p>If we look at our bonded debt, we find it is now
$2,107,936,300, upon which we pay not less than
$124,000,000 in annual interest, the larger part at six
per cent., the smaller at five per cent., gold. The difference
between this interest and that paid by other
powers is the measure of our annual loss. English
three per cents. and French fours are firm in the market;
but England and France have not the same immeasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
resources that are ours, nor is either so secure
in its government. It is easy to see that our debt
could have been funded without paying more than four
per cent., but for the doubt cast upon our credit by
the dishonest schemes of Repudiation. “Payment in
Greenbacks” and “Taxation of Bonds” are costly cries.
Without these there would have been $40,000,000 annually
to swell our surplus revenue. But this sum, if
invested in a sinking fund at four per cent. interest,
would pay the whole bonded debt in less than thirty
years. Such is our annual loss.</p>

<p>The sum-total of this loss directly chargeable upon
the Repudiators is more than one hundred millions, already
paid in taxes; and much I fear, fellow-citizens,
that, before the nation can recover from the discredit
inflicted upon it, another hundred millions will be paid
in the same way. It is hard to see this immense treasure
wrung by taxation from the toil of the people to
pay these devices of a dishonest Democracy. Do not
forget that the cost of this experiment is confined to no
particular class. Wherever the tax-gatherer goes, there
it is paid. Every workman pays it in his food and
clothing; every mechanic and artisan, in his tools;
every housewife, in her cooking-stove and flat-iron;
every merchant, in the stamp upon his note; every
man of salary, in the income tax; ay, every laborer,
in his wood, his coal, his potatoes, and his salt. Many
of these taxes, imposed under duress of war, will be removed
soon, I trust; but still the enormous sum of forty
millions annually must be contributed by the labor of
the country, until the world is convinced, that, in spite
of Democratic menace, the Republic will maintain its
plighted faith to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>People wish to reduce taxation. I tell you how.
Let no doubt rest upon the Public Faith. Then will
the present burdensome taxation grow “fine by degrees
and beautifully less.” <i>It is the doubt which costs.</i> It is
with our country, as with an individual,&mdash;the doubt
obliges the payment of <i>extra interest</i>. To stop that extra
interest we must keep faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we look at the origin of the greenback, we shall
find a new motive for fidelity. I do not speak of that
patriotic character which commends the national debt,
but of the financial principle on which the greenback
was first issued. It came from the overruling exigencies
of self-defence. The national existence depended
upon money, which could be had only through a forced
loan. The greenback was the agency by which it was
collected. The disloyal party resisted the passage of
the original Act, prophesying danger and difficulty; but
the safety of the nation required the risk, and the Republican
Party assumed it. And now this same disloyal
party, once against the greenback, insist upon continuing
in peace what was justified only in war,&mdash;insist
upon a forced loan, when the overruling exigencies of
self-defence have ceased, and the nation is saved. To
such absurdity is this party now driven.</p>

<p>The case is aggravated, when we consider the boundless
resources of the country, through which in a short
time even this great debt will be lightened, if the praters
of Repudiation are silenced. Peace, financially as
well as politically, is needed. Let us have peace. Nowhere
will it be felt more than at the South, which
is awakening to a consciousness of resources unknown
while Slavery ruled. With these considerable additions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to the national capital, five years cannot pass without a
sensible diminution of our burdens. A rate of taxation,
<i>per capita</i>, equal to only one half that of 1866, will pay
even our present interest, all present expenses, and the
entire principal, in less than twenty years. But to this
end we must keep faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The attempt is aggravated still further, when it is
considered that Repudiation is impossible. Try as you
may, you cannot succeed. You may cause incalculable
distress, and postpone the great day of peace, but you
cannot do this thing. The national debt never can be
repudiated. It will be paid, dollar for dollar, in coin,
with interest to the end.</p>

<p>How little do these Repudiators know the mighty
resisting power which they encounter! how little, the
mighty crash which they invite! As well undertake to
move Mount Washington from its everlasting base, or
to shut out the ever-present ocean from our coasts. It
is needless to say that the crash would be in proportion
to the mass affected, being nothing less than the whole
business of the country. Now it appears from investigations
making at this moment by Commissioner Wells,
whose labors shed such light on financial questions, that
<i>our annual product reaches the sum of seven thousand
millions of dollars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But this prodigious amount depends
for its value upon exchange, which in turn depends
upon credit. Destroy exchange, and even these
untold resources would be an infinite chaos, without
form and void. Employment would cease, capital would
waste, mills would stop, the rich would become poor,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
poor, I fear, would starve. Savings banks, trust
companies, insurance companies would disappear. Such
would be the mighty crash; but here you see also the
mighty resisting power. Therefore, again do I say, Repudiation
is impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. Boutwell is criticized by the Democracy because
he buys up bonds, paying the current market rates,
when he should pay the face in greenbacks. I refer
to this Democratic criticism because I would show how
little its authors look to consequences while forgetting
the requirements of Public Faith. Suppose the Secretary,
yielding to these wise suggestions, should announce
his purpose to take up the first ten millions
of five-twenties, paying the face in greenbacks. What
then? “After us the deluge,” said the French king;
and so, after such notice from our Secretary, would our
deluge begin. At once the entire bonded debt would be
reduced to greenbacks. The greenback would not be
raised; the bond would be drawn down. All this at
once,&mdash;and in plain violation of the solemn declaration
of both Houses of Congress pledging payment in coin.
But who can measure the consequences? Bonds would
be thrown upon the market. From all points of the
compass, at home and abroad, they would come. Business
would be disorganized. Prices would be changed.
Labor would be crushed. The fountains of the great
deep would be broken up, and the deluge would be
upon us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the practical agencies to which the country
owes much already are the National Banks. Whatever
may be the differences of opinion with regard to them,
they cannot fail to be taken into account in all financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
discussions. As they have done good where they are
now established, I would gladly see them extended, especially
at the South and West, where they are much
needed, and where abundant crops already supply the
capital. It is doubtful if this can be brought about
without removing the currency limitation in the existing
Bank Act.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In this event I should like the condition
that for every new bank-note issued a greenback
should be cancelled, thus substituting the bank-note for
the greenback. In this way greenbacks would be reduced
in volume, while currency is supplied by the
banks. Such diminution of the national paper would
be an important stage toward specie payments, while
the national banks in the South and West, founded on
the bonds of the United States, would be a new security
for the national credit.</p>

<p>In making this suggestion, I would not forget the
necessity of specie payments at the earliest possible
moment; nor can I forbear to declare my unalterable
conviction that by proper exertion this supreme object
may be accomplished promptly,&mdash;always provided the
national credit is kept above suspicion, or, like the good
knight, “without fear and without reproach.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, fellow-citizens, at every turn are we brought
back to one single point, the Public Faith, which cannot
be dishonored without infinite calamity. The child
is told not to tell a lie; but this injunction is the same
for the full-grown man, and for the nation also. We
cannot tell a lie to the national freedman or the national
creditor; we cannot tell a lie to anybody. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
word of shame cannot be ours. But falsehood to the
national freedman and the national creditor is a national
lie. Breaking promise with either, you are dishonored,
and <i>Liar</i> must be stamped upon the forehead of
the nation. Beyond the ignominy, which all of us must
bear, will be the influence of such a transgression in
discrediting Republican Government and the very idea
of a Republic. For weal or woe, we are an example.
Mankind is now looking to us, and just in proportion
to the eminence we have reached is the eminence of our
example. Already we have shown how a Republic can
conquer in arms, offering millions of citizens and untold
treasure at call. It remains for us to show how a Republic
can conquer in a field more glorious than battle,
where all these millions of citizens and all this untold
treasure uphold the Public Faith. Such an example
will elevate Republican Government, and make the
idea of a Republic more than ever great and splendid.
Helping here, you help not only your own country, but
help Humanity also,&mdash;help liberal institutions in all
lands,&mdash;help the down-trodden everywhere, and all
who struggle against the wrong and tyranny of earth.</p>

<p>The brilliant Frenchman, Montesquieu, in that remarkable
work which occupied so much attention during
the last century, “The Spirit of Laws,” pronounces
<i>Honor</i> the animating sentiment of Monarchy, but <i>Virtue</i>
the animating sentiment of a Republic.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It is for us to
show that he was right; nor can we depart from this
rule of Virtue without disturbing the order of the universe.
Faith is nothing less than a part of that sublime
harmony by which the planets wheel surely in their
appointed orbits, and nations are summoned to justice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Nothing too lofty for its power, nothing too lowly for
its protection. It is an essential principle in the divine
Cosmos, without which confusion reigns supreme. All
depends upon Faith. Why do you build? Because
you have faith in those laws by which you are secured
in person and property. Why do you plant? why do
you sow? Because you have faith in the returning seasons,
faith in the generous skies, faith in the sun. But
faith in this Republic must be fixed as the sun, which
illumines all. I cannot be content with less. Full well
I see that every departure from this great law is only to
our ruin, and from the height we have reached the tumble
will be like that of the Grecian god from the battlements
of Heaven:&mdash;</p>

<p>It only remains, come what may, that we should at
all hazards preserve this Public Faith,&mdash;never forgetting
that honesty is not only the best policy, but the
Golden Rule. For myself, I see nothing more practical,
at this moment, than, first, at all points to oppose the
Democracy, and, secondly, to insist that yet awhile
longer ex-Rebels shall be excused from copartnership
in government. Do not think me harsh; do not think
me austere. I am not. I will not be outdone by anybody
in clemency; nor at the proper time will I be behind
any one in opening all doors of office and trust.
But the proper time has not yet come. There must be
security for the future, unquestionable and ample, before
I am ready; and this I would require not only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the sake of the national freedman and the national
creditor, but for the sake of the country containing the
interests of all, and also of the ex-Rebel himself, whose
truest welfare is in that peace where all controversy
shall be extinguished forever. In this there is nothing
but equity and prudence according to received precedents.
The ancient historian declares that the ancestors
of Rome, the most religious of men, took nothing
from the vanquished but the license to do wrong: “<i>Nostri
majores, religiosissimi mortales, … neque victis quicquam
præter injuriæ licentiam eripiebant</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> These are
the words of Sallust. I know no better example for
our present guidance. Who can object, if men recently
arrayed against their country are told to stand aside
yet a little longer, until all are secure in their rights?
Here is no fixed exclusion,&mdash;nothing of which there
can be any just complaint,&mdash;nothing, which is not practical,
wise, humane,&mdash;nothing which is not born of justice
rather than victory. In the establishment of Equal
Rights conquest loses its character, and is no longer
conquest;&mdash;</p>

<p>Even in the uncertainty of the future it is easy to see
that the national freedman and the national creditor
have a common fortune. In the terrible furnace of war
they were joined together, nor can they be separated
until the rights of both are fixed beyond change. Therefore,
could my voice reach them, I would say, “Freedman,
stand by the creditor! Creditor, stand by the
freedman!” And to the people I would say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> “Stand
by both!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From affairs at home I turn to affairs abroad, and
here I wish to speak cautiously. In speaking at all I
break a vow with myself not to open my lips on these
questions except in the Senate. I yield to friendly
pressure. And yet I know no reason why I should not
speak. It was Talleyrand who, to somebody apologizing
for what might be an indiscreet question, replied,
that an answer might be indiscreet, but not a question.
My answer shall at least be frank.</p>

<p>In our foreign relations there are with me two cardinal
principles, which I have no hesitation to avow at
all times: first, peace with all the world; and, secondly,
sympathy with all struggling for Human Rights.
In neither of these would I fail; for each is essential.
Peace is our all-conquering ally. Through peace the
whole world will be ours. “Still in the right hand
carry gentle peace,” and there is nothing we cannot do.
Filled with the might of peace, the sympathy we extend
will have a persuasive power. Following these
plain principles, we should be open so that foreign nations
shall know our sentiments, and in such way that
even where there is a difference there shall be no just
cause for offence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this spirit I would now approach Spain. Who
can forget that great historic monarchy, on whose empire,
encircling the globe, the sun never set? Patron of
that renowned navigator through whom she became the
discoverer of this hemisphere, her original sway within
it surpassed that of any other power. At last her extended
possessions on the main, won by Cortés and Pizarro,
loosed themselves from her grasp, to take their
just place in the Family of Nations. Cuba and Porto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Rico, rich islands of the Gulf, remained. And now Cuban
insurgents demand independence also. For months
they have engaged in deadly conflict with the Spanish
power. Ravaged provinces and bloodshed are the witnesses.
The beautiful island, where sleeps Christopher
Columbus, with the epitaph that he gave to Castile and
Leon a new world,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> is fast becoming a desert, while the
nation to which he gave the new world is contending
for its last possession there. On this simple statement
two questions occur: first, as to the duty of Spain; and,
secondly, as to the duty of the United States.</p>

<p>Unwelcome as it may be to that famous Castilian
pride which has played so lofty a part in modern Europe,
Spain must not refuse to see the case in its true
light; nor can she close her eyes to the lesson of history.
She must recall how the Thirteen American Colonies
achieved independence against all the power of
England,&mdash;how all her own colonies on the American
main achieved independence against her own most
strenuous efforts,&mdash;how at this moment England is preparing
to release her Northern colonies from their condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of dependence; and recalling these examples, it
will be proper for her to consider if they do not illustrate
a tendency of all colonies, which was remarked by
an illustrious Frenchman, even before the independence
of the United States. Never was anything more prophetic
in politics than when Turgot, in 1750, speaking
of the Phœnician colonies in Greece and Asia Minor,
said: “Colonies are like fruits, which hold to the tree
only until their maturity: when sufficient for themselves,
they did that which Carthage afterwards did,&mdash;<i>that
which some day America will do</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> These most
remarkable words of the philosopher-statesman will be
found in his Discourse at the Sorbonne; and now for
their application. Has not Cuba reached his condition
of maturity? Is it not sufficient for itself? At all
events, is victory over a colony contending for independence
worth the blood and treasure it will cost?
These are serious questions, which can be answered
properly only by putting aside all passion and prejudice
of empire, and calmly confronting the actual condition
of things. Nor must the case of Cuba be confounded
for a moment with our wicked Rebellion, having for
its object the dismemberment of a Republic, to found a
new power with Slavery as its vaunted corner-stone.
For myself, I cannot doubt, that, in the interest of both
parties, Cuba and Spain, and in the interest of humanity
also, the contest should be closed. This is my judgment
on the facts, so far as known to me. Cuba must
be saved from its bloody delirium, or little will be left
for the final conqueror. Nor can the enlightened mind
fail to see that the Spanish power on this island is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
anachronism. The day of European colonies has passed,&mdash;at
least in this hemisphere, where the rights of man
were first proclaimed and self-government first organized.
A governor from Europe, nominated by a crown,
is a constant witness against these fundamental principles.</p>

<p>As the true course of Spain is clear, so to my mind is
the true course of the United States equally clear. It
is to avoid involving ourselves in any way. Enough of
war have we had, without heedlessly assuming another;
enough has our commerce been driven from the ocean,
without heedlessly arousing another enemy; enough of
taxation are we compelled to bear, without adding another
mountain. Two policies were open to us at the
beginning of the insurrection. One was to unite our
fortunes with the insurgents, assuming the responsibilities
of such an alliance, with the hazard of letters-of-marque
issued by Spain and of public war. I say nothing
of the certain consequences in expenditure and in
damages. A Spanish letter-of-marque would not be less
destructive than the English Alabama. The other policy
was to make Spain feel that we wish her nothing
but good,&mdash;and that, especially since the expulsion of
her royal dynasty, we cherish for her a cordial and
kindly sympathy. It is said that republics are ungrateful;
but I would not forget that at the beginning
of our Revolutionary struggle our fathers were aided
by her money, as afterwards by her arms, and that
her great statesman, Florida Blanca, by his remarkable
energies determined the organization of that Armed
Neutrality in Northern Europe which turned the scale
against England,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>&mdash;so that John Adams declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> “We
owe the blessings of peace to the Armed Neutrality.”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
I say nothing of the motives by which Spain was then
governed. It is something that in our day of need she
lent us a helping hand.</p>

<p>It is evident, that, adopting the first policy, we should
be powerless, except as an enemy. The second policy
may enable us to exercise an important influence.</p>

<p>The more I reflect upon the actual condition of Spain,
the more I am satisfied that the true rule for us is non-intervention,
except in the way of good offices. This
ancient kingdom is now engaged in comedy and tragedy.
You have heard of <i>Hunting the Slipper</i>. The
Spanish comedy is <i>Hunting a King</i>. The Spanish tragedy
is sending armies against Cuba. I do not wish to
take part in the comedy or the tragedy. If Spain is
wise, she will give up both. Meanwhile we have a
duty which is determined by International Law. To
that venerable authority I repair. What that prescribes
I follow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By that law, as I understand it, nations are not left
to any mere caprice. There is a rule of conduct which
they must follow, subject always to just accountability
where they depart from it. On ordinary occasions there
is no question; for it is with nations as with individuals.
It is only where the rule is obscure or precedents
are uncertain that doubt arises, as with some persons
now. Here I wish to be explicit. Belligerence is a
“fact,” attested by evidence. If the “fact” does not
exist, there is nothing to recognize. The fact cannot
be invented or imagined; it must be proved. No matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
what our sympathy, what the extent of our desires,
we must look at the fact. There may be insurrection
without reaching this condition, which is at least
the half-way house to independence. The Hungarians,
when they rose against Austria, obtained no such recognition,
although they had large armies in the field, and
Kossuth was their governor; the Poles, in repeated insurrections
against Russia, obtained no such recognition,
although the conflict made Europe vibrate; the Sepoys
and Rajahs of India failed also, although for a time the
English empire hung trembling; nor, in my opinion,
were our slave-mad Rebels ever entitled to such recognition,&mdash;for,
whatever the strength of the Rebellion on
land, it remained, as in the case of Hungary, of Poland,
of India, without those Prize Courts which are absolutely
essential to recognition by foreign powers. <i>A
cruiser without accountability to Prize Courts is a lawless
monster which civilized nations cannot sanction.</i> Therefore
the Prize Court is the condition-precedent; nor is
this all. If the Cuban insurgents have come within
any of the familiar requirements, I have never seen the
evidence. They are in arms, I know. But where are
their cities, towns, provinces? where their government?
where their ports? where their tribunals of justice? and
where their Prize Courts? To put these questions is
to answer them. How, then, is the “fact” of belligerence?</p>

<p>There is another point in the case, which is with me
final. Even if they come within the prerequisites of
International Law, I am unwilling to make any recognition
of them so long as they continue to hold human
beings as slaves, which I understand they now do. I
am told that there was a decree in May last, purporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to be signed by Cespedes, abolishing slavery; then I
am told of another decree in July, maintaining slavery.
There is also the story of a pro-slavery constitution to
be read at home, and an anti-slavery constitution to be
read abroad. Nor is there any evidence that any decree
or constitution has had any practical effect. In
this uncertainty I shall wait, even if all other things
are propitious. In any event there must be Emancipation.</p>

<p>On the recognition of belligerence there is much latitude
of opinion,&mdash;some asserting that a nation may
take this step whenever it pleases; but this pretension
excludes the idea that belligerence is always a question
of fact on the evidence. Undoubtedly an independent
nation may do anything in its power, whenever it
pleases,&mdash;but subject always to just accountability, if
another suffers from what it does. This may be illustrated
in the three different cases of war, independence,
and belligerence. In each case the declaration is an exercise
of high prerogative, inherent in every nation, and
kindred to that of eminent domain; but a nation declaring
war without just cause becomes a wrong-doer;
a nation recognizing independence where it does not
exist in fact becomes a wrong-doer; and so a nation
recognizing belligerence where it does not exist in fact
becomes a wrong-doer also. Any present uncertainty
on this last point I attribute to the failure of precedents
sufficiently clear and authoritative; but with me
there is one rule in such a case which I cannot disobey.
In the absence of any precise injunction, I do
not hesitate to adopt that interpretation of International
Law which most restricts war and all that makes for
war,&mdash;believing that in this way I shall best promote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
civilization and obtain new security for international
peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the case of Spain I pass to the case of England,
contenting myself with a brief explanation. On this
subject I have never spoken except with pain, as I have
been obliged to expose a great transgression. I hope to
say nothing now which shall augment difficulties,&mdash;although,
when I consider how British anger was aroused
by an effort in another place,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> judged by all who heard
it most pacific in character, I do not know that even
these few words may not be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that we received from England
incalculable wrong,&mdash;greater, I have often said,
than was ever before received by one civilized power
from another, short of unjust war. I do not say this
in bitterness, but in sadness. There can be no doubt,
that, through English complicity, our carrying-trade
was transferred to English bottoms,&mdash;our foreign commerce
sacrificed, while our loss was England’s gain,&mdash;our
blockade rendered more expensive,&mdash;and generally,
that our war, with all its fearful cost of blood and treasure,
was prolonged indefinitely. This terrible complicity
began with the wrongful recognition of Rebel belligerence,
under whose shelter pirate ships were built and
supplies sent forth. All this was at the very moment
of our mortal agony, in the midst of a struggle for national
life; and it was done in support of Rebels whose
single declared object of separate existence as a nation
was Slavery, being in this respect clearly distinguishable
from an established power where slavery is tolerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
without being made the vaunted corner-stone.
Such is the case. Who shall fix the measure of this
great accountability? For the present it is enough to
expose it. I make no demand,&mdash;not a dollar of money,
not a word of apology. I show simply what England
has done to us. It will be for her, on a careful review
of the case, to determine what reparation to offer; it
will be for the American people, on a careful review of
the case, to determine what reparation to require. On
this head I content myself with the aspiration that out
of this surpassing wrong, and the controversy it has
engendered, may come some enduring safeguard for the
future, some landmark of Humanity. Then will our
losses end in gain for all, while the Law of Nations is
elevated. But I have little hope of any adequate settlement,
until our case, in its full extent, is heard. In all
controversies the first stage of justice is to understand
the case; and sooner or later England must understand
ours.</p>

<p>The English arguments, so far as argument can be
found in the recent heats, have not in any respect impaired
the justice of our complaint. Loudly it is said
that there can be no sentimental damages, or damages
for wounded feelings; and then our case is dismissed,
as having nothing but this foundation. Now, without
undertaking to say that there is no remedy in the case
supposed, I wish it understood that our complaint is for
damages traced directly to England. If the amount is
unprecedented, so also is the wrong. The scale of damages
is naturally in proportion to the scale of operations.
Who among us doubts that these damages were
received? Call them what you please, to this extent
the nation lost. The records show how our commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
suffered, and witnesses without number testify how the
blockade was broken and the war prolonged. Ask any
of our great generals,&mdash;ask Sherman, Sheridan, Thomas,
Meade, Burnside,&mdash;ask Grant. In view of this transcendent
wrong, it is a disparagement of International
Law to say that there is no remedy. An eminent English
judge once pronounced from the bench that “the
law is astute to find a remedy”; but no astuteness
is required in this case,&mdash;nothing but simple justice,
which is always the object of a true diplomacy. How
did the nation suffer? To what extent? These are the
practical questions. No technicality can be set up on
either side. <i>Damages</i> are <i>damages</i>, no matter by what
artificial term they may be characterized. Opposing
them as <i>consequential</i> shows the disposition to escape
by technicality, even while confessing an equitable liability,&mdash;since
England is bound for <i>all the consequences</i>
of her conduct, bound under International Law, which
is a Law of Equity always, and bound, no matter how
the damages occurred, <i>always provided they proceeded
from her</i>. Because the damages are national, because
all suffered instead of one, this is no reason for immunity
on her part.</p>

<p>Then it is said, “Why not consider our good friends
in England, and especially those noble working-men
who stood by us so bravely?” We do consider them
always, and give them gratitude for their generous alliance.
They belong to what our own poet has called
“the nobility of labor.” But they are not England.
We trace no damages to them, nor to any class, high
or low, but to England, corporate England, through
whose Government we suffered.</p>

<p>Then, again, it is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> “Why not exhibit an account
against France?” For the good reason, that, while
France erred with England in recognition of Rebel
belligerence, no pirate ships or blockade-runners were
built under shelter of this recognition to prey upon our
commerce. The two cases are wide asunder, and they
are distinguished by two different phrases of the Common
Law. The recognition of Rebel belligerence in
France was wrong without injury; but that same recognition
in England was wrong with injury, and it is of
this unquestionable injury that we complain.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, it cannot be doubted that this great
question, so long as it continues pending, will be a
cloud always upon the relations of two friendly powers,
when there should be sunshine. Good men on both
sides should desire its settlement, and in such way as
most to promote good-will, and make the best precedent
for civilization. But there can be no good-will without
justice, nor can any “snap judgment” establish any rule
for the future. Nothing will do now but a full inquiry,
without limitation or technicality, and a candid acceptance
of the result. There must be equity, which is
justice without technicality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sometimes there are whispers of territorial compensation,
and Canada is named as the consideration. But he
knows England little, and little also of that great English
liberty from Magna Charta to the Somerset case,
who supposes that this nation could undertake any
such transfer. And he knows our country little, and
little also of that great liberty which is ours, who supposes
that we could receive such a transfer. On each
side there is impossibility. Territory may be conveyed,
but not a people. I allude to this suggestion only because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
appearing in the public press, it has been answered
from England.</p>

<p>But the United States can never be indifferent to
Canada, nor to the other British provinces, near neighbors
and kindred. It is well known historically, that,
even before the Declaration of Independence, our fathers
hoped that Canada would take part with them.
Washington was strong in this hope; so was Franklin.
The Continental Congress, by solemn resolution,
invited Canada, and then appointed a Commission, with
Benjamin Franklin at its head, “to form an Union between
the United Colonies and the people of Canada.”
In the careful instructions of the Congress, signed in
their behalf by John Hancock, President, the Commissioners
are, among other things, enjoined “in the strongest
terms to assure the people of Canada that it is our
earnest desire to adopt them into our Union as a sister
Colony, and to secure the same general system of mild
and equal laws for them and for ourselves, with only
such local differences as may be agreeable to each Colony
respectively”; and further, that in the judgment of
the Congress “their interest and ours are inseparably
united.”<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Long ago the Continental Congress passed away, living
only in its deeds. Long ago the great Commissioner
rested from his labors, to become a star in our firmament.
But the invitation survives, not only in the archives
of our history, but in all American hearts, constant
and continuing as when first issued, believing, as
we do, that such a union, in the fulness of time, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the good-will of the mother country and the accord of
both parties, must be the harbinger of infinite good.
Nor do I doubt that this will be accomplished. Such
a union was clearly foreseen by the late Richard Cobden,
who, in a letter to myself, bearing date, London,
7th November, 1849, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I agree with you that Nature has decided that <i>Canada
and the United States must become one</i> for all purposes of
intercommunication. Whether they also shall be united in
the same Federal Government must depend upon the two
parties to the union. I can assure you that there will be no
repetition of the policy of 1776 on our part, to prevent our
North American colonies from pursuing their interests in
their own way. If the people of Canada are tolerably unanimous
in wishing to sever the very slight thread which now
binds them to this country, I see no reason why, if good
faith and ordinary temper be observed, it should not be done
amicably.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly twenty years have passed since these prophetic
words, and enough has already taken place to give
assurance of the rest. “Reciprocity,” once established
by treaty, and now so often desired on both sides, will
be transfigured in Union, while our Plural Unit is
strengthened and extended.</p>

<p>The end is certain; nor shall we wait long for its
mighty fulfilment. Its beginning is the establishment
of peace at home, through which the national unity
shall become manifest. This is the first step. The rest
will follow. In the procession of events it is now at
hand, and he is blind who does not discern it. From
the Frozen Sea to the tepid waters of the Mexican Gulf,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the whole vast continent,
smiling with outstretched prairies, where the coal-fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
below vie with the infinite corn-fields above,&mdash;teeming
with iron, copper, silver, and gold,&mdash;filling fast
with a free people, to whom the telegraph and steam
are constant servants,&mdash;breathing already with schools,
colleges, and libraries,&mdash;interlaced by rivers which are
great highways,&mdash;studded with inland seas where fleets
are sailing, and “poured round all old Ocean’s” constant
tides, with tributary commerce and still expanding
domain,&mdash;such will be the Great Republic, One
and Indivisible, with a common Constitution, a common
Liberty, and a common Glory.</p>

<h3>LECTURE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In asking you to consider the
Question of Caste, I open a great subject of immediate
practical interest. Happily, Slavery no longer
exists to disturb the peace of our Republic; but it is
not yet dead in other lands, while among us the impious
pretension of this great wrong still survives against
the African because he is black and against the Chinese
because he is yellow. Here is nothing less than the
claim of hereditary power from color; and it assumes
that human beings cast in the same mould with ourselves,
and in all respects <i>men</i>, with the same title of
manhood that we have, may be shut out from Equal
Rights on account of the skin. Such is the pretension,
plainly stated.</p>

<p>On other occasions it has been my duty to show how
inconsistent is this pretension with our character as a
Republic, and with the promises of our fathers,&mdash;all
of which I consider it never out of order to say and
to urge. But my present purpose is rather to show
how inconsistent it is with that sublime truth, being
part of God’s law for the government of the world,
which teaches the Unity of the Human Family, and its
final harmony on earth. In this law, which is both
commandment and promise, I find duties and hopes,&mdash;perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
duties never to be postponed, and perpetual
hopes never to be abandoned, so long as Man
is Man.</p>

<p>Believing in this law, and profoundly convinced that
by the blessing of God it will all be fulfilled on earth,
it is easy to see how unreasonable is a claim of power
founded on any unchangeable physical incident derived
from birth. Because man is black, because man is yellow,
he is none the less Man; because man is white, he
is none the more Man. By this great title he is universal
heir to all that Man can claim. Because he is
Man, and not on account of color, he enters into possession
of the promised dominion over the animal kingdom,&mdash;“over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon
the earth.” But this equal copartnership without distinction
of color symbolizes equal copartnership in all
the Rights of Man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I enter upon this important theme, I confess an
unwelcome impediment, partly from the prevailing prejudice
of color, which has become with many what is
sometimes called a second nature, and partly from the
little faith among men in the future development of the
race. The cry, “A white man’s government,” which is
such an insult to human nature, has influence in the
work of degradation. Accustomed to this effrontery,
people do not see its ineffable absurdity, which is made
conspicuous, if they simply consider the figure our fathers
would have cut, had they declared the equal rights
of <i>white</i> men, and not the equal rights of <i>men</i>. The
great Declaration was axiomatic and self-evident because
universal; confined to a class, it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
neither. Hearkening to this disgusting cry, people close
the soul to all the quickening voices, whether of prophet,
poet, or philosopher, by which we are encouraged
to persevere; nor do they heed the best lessons of science.</p>

<p>I begin by declaring an unalterable faith in the Future,
which nothing can diminish or impair. Other
things I may renounce, but this I cannot. Throughout
a life of controversy and opposition, frequently in a
small minority, sometimes almost alone, I have never
for a moment doubted the final fulfilment of the great
promises for Humanity without which this world would
be a continuing chaos. To me it was clear from the beginning,
even in the early darkness, and then in the
bloody mists of war, that Slavery must yield to well-directed
efforts against it; and now it is equally clear
that every kindred pretension must yield likewise, until
all are in the full fruition of those equal rights which
are the crown of life on earth. Nor can this great triumph
be restricted to our Republic. Wherever men
are gathered into nations, wherever Civilization extends
her beneficent sway, there will it be manifest. Against
this lofty truth the assaults of the adversary are no better
than the arrows of barbarians vainly shot at the sun.
Still it moves, and it will move until all rejoice in its
beams. The “all-hail Hereafter,” in which the poet
pictures personal success, is a feeble expression for that
transcendent Future where man shall be conqueror, not
only over nations, but over himself, subduing pride of
birth, prejudice of class, pretension of Caste.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The assurances of the Future are strengthened, when
I look at Government and see how its character constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
improves as it comes within the sphere of
knowledge. Men must know before they can act wisely;
and this simple rule is applicable alike to individuals
and communities. “Go, my son,” said the Swedish
Chancellor, “and see with what little wisdom the world
is governed.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Down to his day government was little
more than an expedient, a device, a trick, for the aggrandizement
of a class, of a few, or, it may be, of one.
Calling itself Commonwealth, it was so in name only.
There were classes always, and egotism was the prevailing
law. Macchiavelli, the much-quoted herald of
modern politics, insisted that all governments, whether
monarchical or republican, owed their origin or reformation
to a single lawgiver, like Lycurgus or Solon.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> If
this was true in his day, it is not in ours. In the presence
of an enlightened people, a single lawgiver, or an
aristocracy of lawgivers, is impossible, while government
becomes the rule of all for the good of all,&mdash;not
the One Man Power, so constant in history,&mdash;not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Triumvirate, sometimes occurring,&mdash;not an Oligarchy,
which is the rule of a few,&mdash;not an Aristocracy, which
is the rule of a class,&mdash;not any combination, howsoever
accepted, sanctioning exclusions,&mdash;but the whole body
of the people, without exclusion of any kind, or, in
the great words of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg,
“government of the people, by the people, and for the
people.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Thus far government has been at best an Art, like
alchemy or astrology, where ministers exercised a subtle
power, or speculators tried imaginative experiments,
seeking some philosopher’s-stone at the expense of the
people. Though in many respects still an Art only, it
is fast becoming a Science founded on principles and
laws from which there can be no just departure. As a
science, it is determined by knowledge, like any other
science, aided by that universal handmaid, the philosophy
of induction. From a succession of particulars the
general rule is deduced; and this is as true of government
as of chemistry or astronomy. Nor do I see reason
to doubt, that, in the evolution of events, the time
is at hand when government will be subordinated to
unquestionable truth, making diversity of opinion as
impossible in this lofty science as it is now impossible
in other sciences already mastered by man. Science accomplishes
part only of its beneficent work, when it
brings physical nature within its domain. That other
nature found in Man must be brought within the same
domain. And is it true that man can look into the unfathomable
Universe, there to measure suns and stars,
that he can penetrate the uncounted ages of the eart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>h’s
existence, reading everywhere the inscriptions upon its
rocks, but that he cannot look into himself, or penetrate
his own nature, to measure human capacities and read
the inscriptions upon the human soul? I do not believe
it. What is already accomplished in such large
measure for the world of matter will yet be accomplished
for that other world of Humanity; and then it
will appear, by a law as precise as any in chemistry or
astronomy, that just government stands only on the consent
of the governed, that all men must be equal before
the law of man as they are equal before the law of God,
and that any discrimination founded on the accident
of birth is inconsistent with that true science of government
which is simply the science of justice on earth.</p>

<p>One of our teachers, who has shed much light on the
science of government,&mdash;I refer to Professor Lieber, of
New York,&mdash;shows that the State is what he calls “a
<i>jural</i> society,” precisely as the Church is a religious society,
and an insurance company a financial society.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
The term is felicitous as it is suggestive. Above the
State rises the image of Justice, lofty, blindfold, with
balance in hand. There it stands in colossal form with
constant lesson of Equal Rights for All, while under
its inspiration government proceeds according to laws
which cannot be disobeyed with impunity, and Providence
is behind to sustain the righteous hand. In proportion
as men are wise, they recognize these laws and
confess the exalted science.</p>

<p>“Know thyself” is the Heaven-descended injunction
which ancient piety inscribed in letters of gold in the
temple at Delphi.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The famous oracle is mute, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
divine injunction survives; nor is it alone. Saint Augustine
impresses it in his own eloquent way, when he
says, “Men go to admire the heights of mountains, and
the great waves of the sea, and the widest flow of rivers,
and the compass of the ocean, and the circuits of the
stars, <i>and leave themselves behind</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Following the early
mandate, thus seconded by the most persuasive of the
Christian Fathers, man will consider his place in the
universe and his relations to his brother man. Looking
into his soul, he will there find the great irreversible
Law of Right, universal for the nation as for himself,
commanding to do unto others as we would have them
do unto us; and under the safeguard of this universal
law I now place the rights of all mankind. It is little
that I can do; but, taking counsel of my desires, I am
not without hope of contributing something to that just
judgment which shall blast the effrontery of Caste as
doubly offensive, not only to the idea of a Republic, but
to Human Nature itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Already you are prepared to condemn Caste, when
you understand its real character. To this end, let me
carry you to that ancient India, with its population of
more than a hundred and eighty millions, where this
artificial discrimination, born of impossible fable, was
for ages the dominating institution of society,&mdash;being,
in fact, what Slavery was in our Rebellion, the corner-stone
of the whole structure.</p>

<p>The Portuguese were the first of European nations
to form establishments in India, and therefore through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
them was the civilized world first acquainted with its
peculiar institutions. But I know no monument of
their presence there, and no contribution from them to
our knowledge of the country, so enduring as the word
Caste, or, in the Portuguese language, <i>Casta</i>, by which
they designated those rigid orders or ranks into which
the people of India were divided. The term originally
applied by them has been adopted in the other languages
of Europe, where it signifies primarily the orders
or ranks of India, but by natural extension any
separate and fixed order of society. In the latter sense
Caste is now constantly employed. The word is too
modern, however, for our classical English literature, or
for that most authentic record of our language, the Dictionary
of Dr. Johnson, when it first saw the light in
1755.</p>

<p>Though the word was unknown in earlier times, the
hereditary discrimination it describes entered into the
political system of modern Europe, where people were
distributed into classes, and the son succeeded to the
condition of his father, whether of privilege or disability,&mdash;the
son of a noble being a noble with great privileges,
the son of a mechanic being a mechanic with
great disabilities. And this inherited condition was applicable
even to the special labor of the father; nor was
there any business beyond its tyrannical control. According
to Macaulay, “the tinkers formed an hereditary
caste.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The father of John Bunyan was a tinker, and
the son inherited the position. The French Revolution
did much to shake this irrational system; yet in many
parts of Europe, down to this day, the son emancipates
himself with difficulty from the class in which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
born. But just in proportion to the triumph of Equality
does Caste disappear.</p>

<p>This institution is essentially barbarous, and therefore
appears in barbarous ages, or in countries not yet
relieved from the early incubus. It flourished side by
side with the sculptured bulls and cuneïform characters
of Assyria, side by side with the pyramids and hieroglyphics
of Egypt. It showed itself under the ambitious
sway of Persia, and even in the much-praised Cecropian
era of Attica. In all these countries Caste was
organized, differing somewhat in divisions, but hereditary
in character. And the same phenomenon arrested
the attention of the conquering Spaniards in Peru. The
system had two distinct elements: first, separation, with
rank and privilege, or their opposite, with degradation
and disability; secondly, descent from father to son, so
that it was perpetual separation from generation to generation.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Hindustan, this dreadful system, which, under the
name of Order, is the organization of disorder, has prolonged
itself to our day, so as to be a living admonition
to mankind. That we may shun the evil it entails, in
whatever shape, I now endeavor to expose its true character.</p>

<p>The regular castes of India are four in number, called
in Sanscrit <i>varnas</i>, or <i>colors</i>, although it does not appear
that by nature they were of different colors. Their origin
will be found in the sacred law-book of the Hindoos,
the “Ordinances of Menu,” where it is recorded
that the Creator caused the Brahmin, the Cshatriya, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Vaisya, and the Sudra, so named from <i>Scripture</i>, <i>Protection</i>,
<i>Wealth</i>, and <i>Labor</i>, to proceed from his mouth, his
arm, his thigh, and his foot, appointing separate duties
for each class. To the Brahmin, proceeding from the
mouth, was allotted the duty of reading the Veda and
of teaching it; to the Cshatriya, proceeding from the
arm, the duty of soldier; to the Vaisya, proceeding
from the thigh, the duty of cultivating the land and
keeping herds of cattle; and to the Sudra, proceeding
from the foot, was appointed the chief duty of serving
the other classes without depreciating their worth.
Such was the original assignment of parts; but, under
the operation of natural laws, those already elevated increased
their importance, while those already degraded
sank lower. Ascent from an inferior class was absolutely
impossible: as well might a vegetable become a
man. The distinction was perpetuated by the injunction
that each should marry only in his own class, with
sanguinary penalties upon any attempted amalgamation.</p>

<p>The Brahmin was child of rank and privilege; the
Sudra, child of degradation and disability. Omitting
the two intermediate classes, soldiers and husbandmen,
look for one moment at the two extremes, as described
by the sacred volume.</p>

<p>The Brahmin is constantly hailed as first-born, and,
by right, chief of the whole creation. This eminence is
declared in various terms. Thus it is said, “When a
Brahmin springs to light, he is born above the world”;
and then again, “Whatever exists in the universe is
all in effect the wealth of the Brahmin.” As he engrosses
the favor of the Deity, so is he entitled to the
veneration of mortals; and thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> “whether learned or
ignorant, he is a powerful divinity, even as fire is
a powerful divinity, whether consecrated or common.”
Immunities of all kinds cluster about him. Not for the
most insufferable crime can he be touched in person or
property; nor can he be called to pay taxes, while all
other classes must bestow their wealth upon him. Such
is the Brahmin, with these privileges crystallized in his
blood from generation to generation.</p>

<p>On the other hand is the Sudra, who is the contrast
in all particulars. As much as the Brahmin is object of
constant veneration, so is the Sudra object of constant
contempt. As one is exalted above Humanity, so is the
other degraded below it. The life of the Sudra is servile,
but according to the sacred volume he was created
by the Self-Existent especially to serve the Brahmin.
Everywhere his degradation is manifest. He holds no
property which a Brahmin may not seize. The crime
he commits is visited with the most condign punishment,
beyond that allotted to other classes subject to
punishment. The least disrespect to a Brahmin is terribly
avenged. For presuming to sit on a Brahmin’s
carpet, the penalty is branding and banishment, or
maiming; for contumelious words to a Brahmin, it is
an iron style ten fingers long thrust red-hot into the
mouth; and for offering instruction to a Brahmin, it is
nothing less than hot oil poured into mouth and ears.
Such is the Sudra; and this fearful degradation, with
all its disabilities, is crystallized in his blood from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>Below these is another more degraded even than the
Sudra, being the outcast, with no place in either of the
four regular castes, and known commonly as the Pariah.
Here is another term imported into familiar usage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
signify generally those on whom society has set its ban.
No person of the regular castes holds communication
with the Pariah. His presence is contaminating. Milk,
and even water, is defiled by his passing shadow, and
cannot be used until purified. The Brahmin sometimes
puts him to death at sight. In well-known language of
our country, once applied to another people, he has no
rights which a Brahmin is bound to respect.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Such a system, so shocking to the natural sense, has
been denounced by all who have considered it, whether
on the spot or at a distance,&mdash;unless I except the excellent
historian Robertson, who seems to find apologies
for it, as men among us find apologies for the caste
which sends its lengthening shadow across our Republic.
I might take your time until late in the evening
unfolding its obvious evil, as exposed by those who
have witnessed its operation. This testimony is collected
in a work entitled “Caste opposed to Christianity,”
by Rev. Joseph Roberts, and published in London
in 1847. I give brief specimens only. A Hindoo converted
to Christianity exposes its demoralizing influence,
when he says, “Caste is the stronghold of pride,
which makes a man think of himself more highly than
he ought to think”; and so also another converted Hindoo,
when he says, “Caste makes a man think that he
is holier than another, and that he has some inherent
virtue which another has not”; and still another converted
Hindoo, when he says, “Caste is part and parcel
of idolatry and all heathen abomination.” But no testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
surpasses that of the eminent Reginald Heber, the
Bishop of Calcutta, when he declares that it is “a system
which tends, more than anything else the Devil
has yet invented, to destroy the feelings of general benevolence,
and to make nine tenths of mankind the
hopeless slaves of the remainder.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Under these protests,
and the growing influence of Christianity, the system
is so far mitigated, that, according to an able writer
whose soul is enlisted against it, “the distinctions are
felt on certain limited occasions only.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> These are
the words of James Mill, interesting always as the author
of the best work on India, and the father of John
Stuart Mill. It is now admitted, that, under constraint
of necessity, the member of a superior caste may descend
to the pursuits of an inferior caste. The lofty
Brahmin engages in traffic, yet he cannot touch “leather”;
for contact with this article of commerce is polluting.
But I am obliged to add that no modification
leaving “distinctions” transmissible with the blood can
be adequate. So long as these continue, the natural
harmonies of society are disturbed and man is degraded.
The system in its mildest form can have nothing but
evil; for it is a constant violation of primal truth, and a
constant obstruction to that progress which is the appointed
destiny of man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Change now the scene,&mdash;from ancient India, and the
shadow of unknown centuries, to our Republic, born on
yesterday. How unlike in venerable antiquity! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
like in the pretension of Caste! Here the caste claiming
hereditary rank and privilege is white, the caste
doomed to hereditary degradation and disability is
black or yellow; and it is gravely asserted that this
difference of color marks difference of race, which in
itself justifies the discrimination. To save this enormity
of claim from indignant reprobation, it is insisted
that the varieties of men do not proceed from a common
stock,&mdash;that they are different in origin,&mdash;that
this difference is perpetuated in their respective capacities;
and the apology concludes with the practical assumption,
that the white man is a superior caste not
unlike the Brahmin, while the black man is an inferior
caste not unlike the Sudra, sometimes even the Pariah;
nor is the yellow man exempted from this same insulting
proscription. When I consider how for a long time
the African was shut out from testifying in court, even
when seeking redress for the grossest outrage, and how
at this time in some places the Chinese is also shut out
from testifying in court, each seems to have been little
better than the Pariah. In stating this assumption of
superiority, which I do not exaggerate, I open a question
of surpassing interest, whether in science, government,
or religion.</p>

<p>Here I must not forget that some, who admit the
common origin of all men, insist that the African is
descended from Ham, son of Noah, through Canaan,
cursed by Noah to be servant of his brethren, and that
therefore he may be degraded even to slavery. But
this apology is not original with us. Nobles in Poland
seized upon it to justify their lordly pretensions, calling
their serfs, though white, descendants of Ham.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
whether employed by Pole or American, it is worthy
only of derision. I do not know that this apology is
invoked for maltreating the Chinese, although he is descended
from Ham as much as the Pole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two passages of Scripture, one in the Old Testament
and the other in the New, both governing this question,
attest the Unity of the Human Family. The first is
in that sublime chapter of Genesis, where, amidst the
wonders of Creation, it is said: “So God created man in
His own image; in the image of God created He him;
male and female created He them. And God blessed
them; and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The
other passage is from that great sermon of Saint Paul,
when, standing in the midst of Mars Hill, he proclaimed
to the men of Athens, and through them to all mankind,
that God “hath made of <i>one blood</i> all nations of
men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> If, as
is sometimes argued, there be ambiguity in the account
of the Creation, or if in any way its authority has been
impaired by scientific criticism, there is nothing of the
kind to detract from the sermon of Saint Paul, which
must continue forevermore venerable and beautiful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Appealing from these texts, the apologists hurry to
Science; and there I follow. But I must compress into
paragraphs what might fill volumes.</p>

<p>Ethnology, to which we repair, is a science of recent
origin, exhibiting the different races or varieties of Man
in their relations with each other, as that other science,
Anthropology, exhibits Man in his relation to the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
world. Nature and History are our authorities,
but all science and all knowledge are tributary. Perhaps
no other theme is grander; for it is the very beginning
of human history, in which all nations and
men have a common interest. Its vastness is increased,
when we consider that it embraces properly not only
the origin, distribution, and capacity of Man, but his
destiny on earth,&mdash;stretching into the infinite past,
stretching also into the infinite future, and thus spanning
Humanity.</p>

<p>The subject is entirely modern. Hippocrates, one of
our ancient masters, has left a treatise on “Air, Water,
and Place,” where climatic influences are recognized;
but nobody in Antiquity studied the varieties of our
race, or regarded its origin except mythically. The discovery
of America, and the later circumnavigation of
the globe, followed by the development of the sciences
generally, prepared the way for this new science.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is obvious to the most superficial observer that
there are divisions or varieties in the Human Family,
commonly called Races; but the most careful explorations
of Science leave the number uncertain. These
differences are in Color and in Skull,&mdash;also in Language.
Of these the most obvious is Color; but here,
again, the varieties multiply in proportion as we consider
transitional or intermediate hues. Two great
teachers in the last century&mdash;Linnæus, of whom it
was said, “God created, Linnæus classified,” <i>Deus creavit,
Linnæus disposuit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and Kant, a sincere and penetrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
seeker of truth&mdash;were content with four,&mdash;white,
copper, tawny or olive, and black,&mdash;corresponding
geographically to European, American, Asiatic, and
African. Buffon, in his eloquent portraiture, recognizes
five, with geographical designations. He was followed
by Blumenbach, who also recognizes five, with the
names which have become so famous since,&mdash;Caucasian,
Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, and Malay.
Here first appears the popular, but deceptive term,
Caucasian; for nobody supposes now that the white
cradle was on Caucasus, which is best known to English-speaking
people by the verse of Shakespeare, making
it anything but Eden,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, who can hold a fire in his hand</div>
<div class="verse">By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Blumenbach was an able and honest inquirer; and if
his nomenclature is defective, it is only another illustration
of the adage, that nothing is at the same time invented
and perfected.</p>

<p>If I mention other attempts, it is only to show how
Science hesitates before this great problem. Cuvier
reduces the Family to three, with branches or subdivisions,
and lends his great authority to the term
Caucasian, which he adopts from Blumenbach. Lesson
began with three, according to color,&mdash;white, yellow,
and black; but afterwards recognized six,&mdash;white, bistre,
orange, yellow, red, black,&mdash;represented respectively
by European, Hindoo, Malay, Mongolian, American,
and Negro, African and Asiatic. Desmoulins makes
eleven. Bory de Saint-Vincent adds to Desmoulins.
Broc adds to Saint-Vincent. The London “Ethnological
Journal” makes no less than sixty-three, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
twenty-eight varieties are intellectual and thirty-five
physical; and we are told<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> that thirty varieties of Caucasian
alone are recognized on the monuments of ancient
Egypt, as they appear in the magnificent works of
Rosellini and Lepsius. Our own countryman, Pickering,&mdash;whose
experience was gained on the Exploring
Expedition of Captain Wilkes,&mdash;in his work on “The
Races of Man and their Geographical Distribution,”
enumerates eleven varieties of Man, divided into four
groups, according to color,&mdash;white, brown, blackish-brown,
and black. In his opinion, “there is no middle
ground between the admission of eleven distinct
species in the Human Family and the reduction to
one.”<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The Dutch anatomist, Camper, distinguishes the Human
Family by the facial angle, ranging from eighty
degrees, in the European, down to seventy degrees, in
the Negro.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This attempt was continued by Virey, who
divides Man into two species: the first with a facial
angle of 85° to 90°, including Caucasian, Mongolian,
and copper-colored American; and the second with a
facial angle of 75° to 82°, including dark-brown Malay,
blackish Hottentot and Papuan, and the Negro. Prichard,
whose voluminous works constitute an ethnological
mine, finds, chiefly from the skull, seven varieties,
which he calls (1.) Iranian, from Iran, the primeval seat
in Persia of the Aryan race, embracing the Caucasian of
Blumenbach with some Asiatic and African nations;
(2.) Turanian or Mongolian; (3.) American, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Esquimaux; (4.) Hottentot and Bushman; (5.) Negro;
(6.) Papuan, or woolly-haired Polynesian; (7.) Australian.
The same industrious observer finds three principal
varieties in the conformation of the head, corresponding
respectively to Savage, Nomadic, and Civilized
Man. In the savage African and Australian the jaw is
prolonged forward, constituting what he calls, by an expressive
term, <i>prognathous</i>. In the nomadic Mongolian
the skull is pyramidal and the face broad. In Civilized
Man the skull is oval or elliptical. But the naturalist
records that there are forms of transition, as nations approach
to civilization or relapse into barbarism.</p>

<p>Thus does the Human Skull refuse any definitive answer.
There are varieties of skull, as of color; but the
question remains, to what extent they attest original diversity.
Equally vain is the attempt to obtain a guide
in the form of the human pelvis. But every such attempt
and its failure have their lesson.</p>

<p>There remains one other criterion: I mean Language.
And here the testimony is such as to disturb all divisions
founded on Color or Skull; for it is ascertained
that people differing in these respects speak languages
having a common origin. The ancient Sanscrit, sometimes
called the most elaborate of human dialects, has
yielded its secret to philological research, and now
stands forth the mother tongue of the European nations.
It is difficult to measure the importance of this
revelation; for, while not decisive on the main question,
it increases our difficulty in accepting any postulate
of original diversity.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the question arises, How are these varieties
to be regarded in the light of science? Are they aboriginal
and from the beginning,&mdash;or are they super-induced
by secondary causes, of which the record is
lost in the extended night preceding our historic day?
Here the authorities are divided. On the one side, we
are reminded that within the period of recognized chronology
no perceptible change has occurred in any of
these varieties,&mdash;that on the earliest monuments of
Egypt the African is pictured precisely as we see him
now, even to that servitude from which among us he is
happily released,&mdash;and it is insisted that no known influences
of climate or place are sufficient to explain
such transformations from an aboriginal type, while
plural types are in conformity with the analogies of
the animal and vegetable world. On the other side, we
are reminded, that, whatever may be the difficulties
from supposing a common centre of Creation, there are
greater still in supposing plural centres,&mdash;that it is easier
to understand one creation than many,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>&mdash;that geographical
science makes us acquainted with intermediate
gradations of color and conformation in which the
great contrasts disappear,&mdash;that, even within the last
half-century and in Europe, people have tended to lose
their national physiognomy and run into a common
type, thus attesting subjection to transforming influences,&mdash;that,
after accepting the races already described,
there are other varieties, national, family, and individual,
not less difficult of explanation,&mdash;and it is insisted,
that, whatever these varieties, be they few or many,
there is among them all <i>an overruling Unity</i>, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
they are constituted one and the same cosmopolitan
species, endowed with speech, reason, conscience, and
the hope of immortality, knitting all together in a
common Humanity, and, amidst all seeming differences,
making all as near to each other as they are far
apart from every other created thing, while to every
one is given that great first instrument of civilization,
the human hand, by which the earth is tilled, cities
built, history written, and the stars measured;&mdash;and
this unquestionable Unity is pronounced all-sufficient
evidence of a common origin.</p>

<p>In considering this great question, do all inquirers
sufficiently recognize the element of Time? Obviously
the sphere of operation is enlarged in proportion to
the time employed. Everything is possible with time.
Confining ourselves to recognized chronology, existing
varieties cannot be reconciled with that unity found in
a common origin. What are the six thousand years of
Hebrew time, what are the twenty-two thousand years
of human annals sanctioned by the learning and piety
of Bunsen,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> for the consummation of these transformations?
And this longest period, how brief for the completion
of those two marvellous languages, Sanscrit and
Greek, which at the earliest dawn of authentic history
were already so perfect! Considering the infinitudes of
astronomy, and those other infinitudes of geology, it is
not unreasonable to claim an antiquity for Primeval
Man compared with which all the years of authentic
history are a span. With such incalculable opportunity,
amidst unknown changes of Nature where heat
and cold strove for mastery, no transformation consistent
with the preservation of the characteristic species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was impossible. Egypt is not alone in its Sphinx, perplexing
mortals with perpetual enigma. Science is our
Sphinx, and its enigma is Man and his varieties on
earth: to which I answer, “Time.”</p>

<p>Nor is it unreasonable to suppose that at the Creation
conditions were stamped upon man, making transformations
natural. Because unnatural according to observation
during the brief period of historic time, it
does not follow that they are not strictly according to
law. The famous Calculating Engine of Charles Babbage,
the distinguished mathematician, as described in
his remarkable “Bridgewater Treatise,” where Science
vindicates anew the ways of Providence to man, supplies
an illustration which is not without instruction.
This machine, with a power almost miraculous, was so
adjusted as to produce a series of natural numbers in
regular order from unity to a number expressed by one
hundred millions and one,&mdash;100,000,001,&mdash;when another
series was commenced, regulated by a different
law, which continued until at a certain number the series
was again changed; and all these changes in the
immense progression proceeded from a propulsion at
the beginning.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Any simple observer, finding that the
series stretched onwards through successive millions,
would have no hesitation in concluding from the vast
induction that it must proceed always according to the
same law; and yet it was not so. But the Calculating
Engine is only a contrivance of human skill. And
cannot the Creator do as much? That is a very inadequate
conception of the Almighty Power creating
the universe and placing man in it, which supposes, according
to the language of Sir John Herschel, the eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
astronomer, that “His combinations are exhausted
upon any one of the theatres of their former exercise.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Thus far we know not the law of the series which governed
Primeval Man. Who can say that after lapse of
time changes did not occur, always in obedience to conditions
stamped upon him at the Creation?</p>

<p>A simpler illustration carries us to the same result.
A cog-wheel, so common in machinery, operates ordinarily
by the cogs on its rim; but the wheel may be so
constructed, that, after a certain series of rotations, another
set of cogs is presented, inducing a different motion.
All can see how, in conformity with preëxisting
law, a change may occur in the operations of the machine.
But it was not less easy for the Creator to fix
His law at the beginning, according to which the evolutions
of this world proceed. And thus are we brought
back to the conclusion, so often announced, that unity
of origin must not be set aside simply because existing
varieties of Man cannot be sufficiently explained by
known laws, operating during that brief period which
we call History.</p>

<p>In considering this great question, there are authorities
which cannot be disregarded. Count them or
weigh them, it is the same. I adduce a few only, beginning
with Latham, the ethnologist, who insists,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(1.) That, as a matter of fact, the languages of the earth’s
surface are referable to one common origin; (2.) that, as a
matter of logic, this common origin of language is <i>primâ facie</i>
evidence of a common origin for those who speak it.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The great French geographer and circumnavigator,
Dumont d’Urville, testifies thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I see on the whole surface of the globe only three types
or divisions of mankind which seem to me to merit the title
of distinct races: the white, more or less colored with red;
the yellow, inclining to different tints of copper or bronze;
and the black.&mdash;I share in the opinion which refers these
three races to one and the same primitive stock, and which
places their common cradle on the central plateau of Asia.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Buffon, the brilliant naturalist, whose work is one of
the French classics, thus records his judgment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All concurs to prove that the human race is not composed
of species essentially different among themselves,&mdash;that,
on the contrary, there was originally but a single species
of men, who, in multiplying and spreading over all the
surface of the globe, have undergone different changes through
the influence of climate, difference of food, difference in the
manner of living, epidemic maladies, and the infinitely varied
intermixture of individuals more or less alike.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another authority, avoiding the question of origin,
has given a summary full of instruction and beauty. I
refer to Alexander von Humboldt, the life-long companion
of every science, to whom all science was revealed,&mdash;who
studied Man in both hemispheres, and
ever afterwards, throughout his long and glorious career,
continued the pursuit. Adopting the words of the
great German anatomist, Johannes Müller, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> “the
different races of mankind are forms of one sole species,
by the union of two individuals of which descendants
are propagated,”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and criticizing the popular classifications
of Blumenbach and Prichard as wanting “typical
sharpness” or “well-established principle,” the author
of “Cosmos” insists that “the distribution of mankind
is only a distribution into <i>varieties</i>, which are commonly
designated by the somewhat indefinite term <i>races</i>,”
and then announces the grand conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whilst we maintain the unity of the human species, we
at the same time repel the depressing assumption of superior
and inferior races of men. There are nations more susceptible
of cultivation, more highly civilized, more ennobled by
mental cultivation, than others, <i>but none in themselves nobler
than others</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the testimony of Science by one of its greatest
masters. Rarely have better words been uttered.
Nor should it be said longer that Science is silent.
Humboldt has spoken. And what he said is much
in little,&mdash;most simple, but most comprehensive; for,
while asserting the Unity of the Human Family, he
repels that disheartening pretension of Caste which
I insist shall find no place in our political system.
Through him Science is enlisted for the Equal Rights
of All.</p>

<p>Whatever the judgment on the unity of origin, where,
from the nature of the case, there can be no final human
testimony, it is a source of infinite consolation that
we can anchor to that other unity found in a common
organization, a common nature, and a common destiny,
being at once physical, moral, and prophetic. This is
the true Unity of the Human Family. In all essentials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
constituting Humanity, in all that makes Man, all varieties
of the human species are one and the same.
There is no real difference between them. The variance,
whether of complexion, configuration, or language,
is external and superficial only, like the dress we wear.
Here all knowledge and every science concur. Anatomy,
physiology, psychology, history, the equal promises
to all men, testify. Look at Man on the dissecting
table, and he is always the same, no matter in what
color he is clad,&mdash;same limbs, same bones, same proportions,
same structure, same upright stature. Look
at Man in the world, and you will find him in nature
always the same,&mdash;modified only by the civilization
about him. There is no human being, black or yellow,
who may not apply to himself the language of
Shakespeare’s Jew:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions?&mdash;fed with the same
food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases,
healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the
same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us,
do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If
you poison us, do we not die?”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Look at Man in his destiny here or hereafter, so
far as it can be penetrated by mortal vision, and who
will venture to claim for any variety or class exclusive
prerogatives on earth or in heaven? Where is this preposterous
pretender? God has given to all the same
longevity, marking a common mortality,&mdash;the same
cosmopolitan character, marking citizenship everywhere,&mdash;and
the same capacity for improvement, marking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that tendency sometimes called the perfectibility of the
race; and He has given to all alike the same promise
of immortal life. By these tokens is Man known everywhere
to be Man, and by these tokens is he everywhere
entitled to the Rights of Man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a lesson in the Dog,&mdash;is there not? Who
does not admire that fidelity which makes this animal
ally and friend of man, following him over the whole
earth, in every climate, under all influences of sky, cosmopolitan
as himself, in prosperity and adversity always
true,&mdash;and then, by beautiful fable, transported to another
world, where the association of life is prolonged
to man, while “his faithful dog shall bear him company”?<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
The dog of Ulysses dying for joy at his master’s
return, when all Ithaca had forgotten the long-absent
lord, is not the only instance. But who has
heard that this wonderful instinct makes any discrimination
of manhood? It is to Man that the dog is faithful;
nor does it matter of what condition, whether the
child of wealth or the rough shepherd tending his
flocks; nor does it matter of what complexion, whether
Caucasian white, or Ethiopian black, or Mongolian
yellow. It is enough that the master is Man; and
thus, even through the instincts of a brute, does Nature
testify to that Unity of the Human Family by virtue
of which all are alike in rights.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Experts in Ethnology are earnest to recognize this
other Unity on which I now insist. Our own Agassiz,
who is the most illustrious of the masters not accepting
the unity of origin, is careful to add,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> “that the moral
question of Brotherhood among men” is not affected by
this dissent; and he announces “that Unity is not only
compatible with diversity of origin, but that it is the
universal law of Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This other Unity found an
eloquent representative in William von Humboldt, not
less eminent as philologist than his brother as naturalist,
who proclaims our Common Humanity to be the
dominant idea of history, more and more extending its
empire, “striving to remove the barriers which prejudice
and limited views of every kind have erected
amongst men, and to treat all mankind, without reference
to religion, nation, or color, as one Fraternity, one
great community”; and he concludes by announcing
“the recognition of the bond of Humanity” as “one
of the noblest leading principles in the history of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
And these grand words are adopted by Alexander
von Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> so that the philologist and the naturalist
unite in this cause. Thus in every direction do
we find new testimony against the pretension of Caste.</p>

<p>We are told that “a little learning is a dangerous
thing.” If this be ever true, it cannot be better illustrated
than by that sciolism which from the varieties of
the human species would overthrow that sublime Unity
which is the first law of Creation. As well overthrow
Creation itself. There is no great intelligence which
does not witness to this law. Bacon, Newton, Leibnitz,
Descartes all testify. Laplace, from the heights of his
knowledge, teaches that the curve described by a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
particle of air or vapor is regulated by a law as certain
as the orbits of the planets; and is not Man the equal
subject of certain law? God rejoices in Unity. It is
with Him a universal law, applicable to all above and
below, from the sun in the heavens to the soul of man.
Not one law for one group of stars, and one law for one
group of men,&mdash;but one law for all stars, and one law
for all men. The saying of Plato, that “God geometrizes,”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
is only another expression for the certainty and
universality of this law. Aristotle follows Plato, when,
borrowing an illustration from the well-known requirements
of the Greek drama, he announces, that “in Nature
nothing is unconnected or out of place, as in a bad
tragedy.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But Caste is unconnected and out of place.
It is a perpetual discord, a prolonged jar,&mdash;contrary to
the first principle of the Universe.</p>

<p>Only when we consider the universality of the Moral
Law can we fully appreciate the grandeur of this Unity.
The great philosopher of Germany, Kant, declared that
there were two things filling him always with admiration,&mdash;the
starry heavens above, and the moral law
within.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Well might the two be joined together; for in
that moral law, with a home in every bosom, is a vastness
and beauty commensurate with the Universe. Every
human being carries a universe in himself; but
here, as in that other universe, is the same prevailing
law of Unity, in harmony with which the starry heavens
move in their spheres and men are constrained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the duties of life. The stars must obey; so must men.
This obedience brings the whole Human Family into
harmony with each other, and also with the Creator.
And here, again, we behold the grandeur of the system,
while new harmonies unfold. Religion takes up the
lesson, and the daily prayer, “Our Father who art in
Heaven,” is the daily witness to the Brotherhood of
Man. God is Universal Father; then are we all brothers.
If not all children of Adam, we are all children of
God,&mdash;if not all from the same father on earth, we are
all from the same Father in Heaven; and this affecting
relationship, which knows no distinction of race or color,
is more vital and ennobling than any monopoly.
Here, once more, is that universal law which forbids
Caste, speaking not only with the voice of Science, but
of Religion also,&mdash;praying, pleading, protesting, in the
name of a Common Father, against such wrong and insult
to our brother man. In beautiful harmony are
those words of promise, “I will make a <i>man</i> more precious
than fine gold, even a man than the golden wedge
of Ophir.”<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Against this lofty recognition of a common
humanity, how mean the pretension of Caste!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Assuming this common humanity, it is difficult to see
how reason can resist the conclusion, that in the lapse
of time there must be a common, universal civilization,
which every nation and every people will share. None
too low, none too inaccessible for its kindred embrace.
Amidst the differences which now exist, and in the contemplation
of nations and peoples infinitely various in
condition, with the barbarian still claiming an extensive
empire, with the savage still claiming a whole continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and islands of the sea, I cannot doubt the certain triumph
of this great law. Believing in God, I believe
also in Man, through whose God-given energies all this
will be accomplished. Was he not told at the beginning,
with the blessing of God upon him, “<i>Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it</i>”?
All of which I am sure will be done. Why this common
humanity, why this common brotherhood, if the
inheritance is for Brahmins only? Why the injunction
to multiply and subdue the earth, if there are to be Sudras
and Pariahs always? Why this sublime law of
Unity, holding the universe in its grasp, if Man alone is
left beyond its reach?</p>

<p>I have already founded the Unity of the Human
Family partly on the common destiny, and I now insist
that this common destiny is attested by the unquestionable
Unity of the Human Family. They are parts of
one system, complements of each other. Why this
unity, if there be no common destiny? How this
common destiny, if there be no unity? Assuming the
unity, then is the common destiny a necessary consequence,
under the law appointed for man.</p>

<p>The skeptic is disturbed, because thus far in our brief
chronology this common civilization has not been developed;
but to my mind it is plain that much has
been done, making the rest certain, through the same
incessant influences, under the great law of Human
Progress.</p>

<p>That European civilization which has already pushed
its conquests in every quarter of the globe is a lesson to
mankind. Beginning with small communities, it has
proceeded stage by stage, extending to larger, until it
embraced nations and distant places,&mdash;and now stamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
itself ineffaceably upon increasing multitudes, making
them, under God, pioneers in the grand march of Humanity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Europe had her dark ages when there was a night
with “darkness visible,” and there was an earlier period
in the history of each nation when Man was not
less savage than now in the very heart of Africa; but
the European has emerged, and at last stands in a
world of light. Take any of the nations whose development
belongs to modern times, and the original degradation
can be exhibited in authentic colors. There is
England, whose present civilization is in many respects
so finished; but when the conquering Cæsar, only fifty-five
years before the birth of Christ, landed on this unknown
island, her people were painted savages, with a
cruel religion, and a conjugal system which was an incestuous
concubinage.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> His authentic report places this
condition beyond question; and thus knowing her original
degradation and her present transformation after
eighteen centuries, we have the terms for a question in
the Rule of Three. Given the original degradation and
present transformation of England, how long will it
take for the degradation of other lands to experience a
similar transformation? Add also present agencies of
civilization, to which England was for centuries a stranger.</p>

<p>This instance is so important as to justify details.
When Britain was first revealed to the commercial enterprise
of Tyre, her people, according to Macaulay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
“were little superior to the natives of the Sandwich
Islands.”<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The historian must mean, when those islands
were first discovered by Captain Cook. Prichard, our
best authority, supposes them “nearly on a level with
the New-Zealanders or Tahitians of the present day, or
perhaps not very superior to the Australians,”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> which
is very low indeed. There was but little change, if
any, when they became known to the Romans. They
are pictured as large and tall, excelling the Gauls in
stature, but less robust, and, according to the geographer
Strabo, with crooked legs and unshapely figures.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Northward were the Caledonians,&mdash;also Britons,&mdash;tattooing
their bodies, dwelling in tents, savage in manners,
and with a moral degradation kindred to that of
the Southern Britons.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Across the Channel were the
Irish, whose reported condition was even more terrible.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
According to Cæsar, most in the interior of Britain
never sowed corn, but lived on milk and flesh,
and were clad in skins; but he notes that all colored
their bodies with a cerulean dye, “making them more
horrid to the sight in battle”; and he then relates, that
societies of ten or twelve, brothers and brothers, parents
and children, had wives in common.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Their religious
observances were such as became this savage life. Here
was the sanctuary of the Druids, whose absolute and
peculiar power was sustained by inhuman rites. On
rude, but terrible altars, in the gloom of the forest, human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
victims were sacrificed,&mdash;while from the blood, as
it coursed under the knife of the priest, there was a
divination of future events.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> There was no industry,
and no production, except slaves too illiterate for the
Roman market. Imagination pictured strange things.
One province was reported where “the ground was covered
with serpents, and the air was such that no man
could inhale it and live.”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In the polite circles of the
Empire the whole region excited a fearful horror, which
has been aptly likened to that of the early Ionians for
“the Straits of Scylla and the city of the Læstrygonian
cannibals.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The historian records with a sigh, that
“no magnificent remains of Latian porches and aqueducts
are to be found” here,&mdash;that “no writer of
British birth is reckoned among the masters of Latian
poetry and eloquence.”<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>And this was England at the beginning. Long afterwards,
when centuries had intervened, the savage was
improved into the barbarian. But from one authentic
instance learn the rest. The trade in slaves was active,
and English peddlers bought up children throughout the
country, while the people, greedy of the price, sold their
own relations, sometimes their own offspring.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In similar
barbarism, all Jews and their gains were the absolute
property of the king; and this law, beginning with
Edward the Confessor, was enforced under successive
monarchs, one of them making a mortgage of all Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to his brother as security for a debt.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Nothing worse is
now said of Africa.</p>

<p>Progress was slow. When in 1435 the Italian Æneas
Sylvius, afterwards Pope Pius the Second, visited this
island, it was to his eyes most forlorn. Houses in cities
were in large part built without lime. Cottages had no
other door than a bull-hide. Food was coarse,&mdash;sometimes,
in place of bread, the bark of trees; and white
bread was such a rarity among the people as to be a curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
When afterwards, under Henry the Eighth,
civilization had begun, the condition of the people was
deplorable. There was no such thing among them as
comfort, while plague and sweating-sickness prevailed.
The learned and ingenious Erasmus, who was an honored
guest in England at this time, refers much to the
filthiness of the houses. The floors he describes as commonly
of clay strewn with rushes, in the renewal of
which those at the bottom sometimes remained undisturbed
for twenty years, retaining filth unmentionable,&mdash;“<i>sputa,
vomitus, mictum canum et hominum, projectam
cervisiam et piscium reliquias, aliasque sordes non
nominandas</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> I quote the words of this eminent observer.
The traveller from the interior of Africa would
hardly make a worse report.</p>

<p>Such was England. But this story of savagery and
barbarism is not peculiar to that country. I might take
other countries, one by one, and exhibit the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
degradation and the present elevation. I might take
France. I content myself with one instance only. An
authentic incident of French history, recorded by a contemporary
witness, and associated with famous names
in the last century, shows the little recognition at that
time of a common humanity. And this story concerns
a lady, remarkable among her sex for various talent,
and especially as a mathematician, and the French
translator of Newton,&mdash;Madame Duchâtelet. This
great lady, the friend of Voltaire, found no difficulty
in undressing before the men-servants of her household,
not considering it well-proved that such persons
were of the Human Family. This curious revelation of
manners, which arrested the attention of De Tocqueville
in his remarkable studies on the origin of the
French Revolution,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> if reported from Africa, would be
recognized as marking a most perverse barbarism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are illustrations only, which might be multiplied
and extended indefinitely, but they are sufficient.
Here, within a limited sphere, obvious to all,
is the operation of that law which governs Universal
Man. Progress here prefigures progress everywhere;
nay, progress here is the first stage in the world’s progress.
Nobody doubts the progress of England; nobody
doubts the progress of France; nobody doubts the progress
of the European Family, wherever distributed, in
all quarters of the globe. But must not the same law
under which these have been elevated exert its equal
influence on the whole Family of Man? Is it not with
people as with individuals? Some arrive early, others
tardily. Who has not observed, that, independently of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
original endowment, the progress of the individual depends
upon the influences about him? Surrounded by
opportunity and trained with care, he grows into the
type of Civilized Man; but, on the other hand, shut out
from opportunity and neglected by the world, he remains
stationary, always a man, entitled from his manhood
to Equal Rights, but an example of inferiority, if
not of degradation. Unquestionably it is the same with
a people. Here, again, opportunity and a training hand
are needed.</p>

<p>To the inquiry, How is this destiny to be accomplished?
I answer, Simply by recognizing the law of
Unity, and acting accordingly. The law is plain; obey
it. Let each people obey the law at home; its extension
abroad will follow. The standard at home will become
the standard everywhere. The harmony at home
will become the harmony of mankind. Drive Caste
from this Republic, and it will be, like Cain, “a fugitive
and a vagabond in the earth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Therefore do I now plead for our Common Humanity
in all lands. Especially do I plead for the African, not
only among us, but in his own vast, mysterious home,
where for unknown centuries he has been the prey of
the spoiler. He may be barbarous, perhaps savage; but
so have others been, who are now in the full enjoyment
of civilization. If you are above him in any respect,
then by your superiority are you bound to be his helper.
Where much is given much is required; and this
is the law for a nation, as for an individual.</p>

<p>The unhappy condition of Africa, a stranger to civilization,
is often invoked against a Common Humanity.
Here again is that sciolism which is the inseparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
ally of every ignoble pretension. It is easy to explain
this condition without yielding to a theory inconsistent
with God’s Providence. The key is found in her geographical
character, affording few facilities for intercommunication
abroad or at home. Ocean and river are
the natural allies of civilization, as England will attest;
for such was their early influence, that Cæsar, on landing,
remarked the superior condition of the people on
the coast.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Europe, indented by seas on the south and
north, and penetrated by considerable rivers, will attest
also. The great geographer, Carl Ritter, who has placed
the whole globe in the illumination of geographical science,
shows that the relation of interior spaces to the
extent of coast has a measurable influence on civilization:
and here is the secret of Africa. While all Asia
is five times as large as Europe, and Africa more than
three times as large, the littoral margins have a different
proportion. Asia has 30,800 miles of coast; Europe
17,200; and Africa only 14,000. For every 156
square miles of the European continent there is one
mile of coast, while in Africa one mile of coast corresponds
to 623 square miles of continent. The relative
extension of coast in Europe is four times greater than
in Africa. Asia is in the middle between the two extremes,
having for every 459 square miles one mile of
coast; and so also is Asia between the two in civilization.
There is still another difference, with corresponding
advantage to Europe. One third part of Europe is
in the nature of ramification from the mass, furnishing
additional opportunities; whereas Africa is a solid,
impenetrable continent, without ramifications, without
opening gulfs or navigable rivers, except the Nile, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
once witnessed the famous Egyptian civilization.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And
now, in addition to all these opportunities by water,
Europe has others not less important from a reticulation
of railways, bringing all parts together, while Africa is
without these new-born civilizers. All these things are
apparent and beyond question; nor can their influence
be doubted. And thus is the condition of Africa explained
without an insult to her people or any new
apology for Caste.</p>

<p>The attempt to disparage the African as inferior to
other men, except in present condition, shows that same
ever-present sciolism. Does Humboldt repel the assumption
of superiority, and beautifully insist that no
people are “in themselves nobler than others”?<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Then
all are men, all are brothers, of the same Human Family,
with superficial and transitional differences only.
Plainly, no differences can make one color superior to
another. And looking carefully at the African, in the
seclusion and isolation of his native home, we see sufficient
reason for that condition which is the chief argument
against him. It is doubtful if any people has become
civilized without extraneous help. Britain was
savage when Roman civilization intervened; so was
Gaul. Cadmus brought letters to Greece; and what is
the story of Prometheus, who stole fire from Heaven,
but an illustration of this law? The African has not
stolen fire; no Cadmus has brought letters to him; no
Roman civilization has been extended over his continent.
Meanwhile left to savage life, he has been a perpetual
victim, hunted down at home to feed the bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
maw of Slavery, and then transported to another hemisphere,
always a slave. In such condition Nature has
had small opportunity for development. No kindly influences
have surrounded his home; no voice of encouragement
has cheered his path; no prospect of trust or
honor has awakened his ambition. His life has been a
Dead Sea, where apples of Sodom floated. And yet his
story is not without passages which quicken admiration
and give assurance for the Future,&mdash;at times melting
to tenderness, and at times inspiring to rage, that these
children of God, with so much of His best gifts, should
be so wronged by their brother man.</p>

<p>The ancient poet tells us that there were heroes before
Agamemnon,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>&mdash;that is, before the poet came to
praise. Who knows the heroes of those vast unvisited
recesses where there is no history and only short-lived
tradition? But among those transported to this hemisphere
heroes have not been wanting. Nowhere in history
was the heroical character more conspicuous than in
our fugitive slaves. Their story, transferred to Greece
or Rome, would be a much-admired chapter, from which
youth would derive new passion for Liberty. The story
of the African in our late war would be another chapter,
awakening kindred emotion. But it is in a slave of
the West Indies, whose parents were stolen from Africa,
that we find an example of genius and wisdom, courage
and character, with all the elements of general and
ruler. The name borne by this remarkable person as
slave was Toussaint, but his success in forcing an <i>opening</i>
everywhere secured for him the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> “l’Ouverture,”
making his name Toussaint l’Ouverture, Toussaint
<i>the Opening</i>, by which he takes his place in history.
He was opener for his people, whom he advanced
from Slavery to Freedom, and then sank under the
power of Napoleon, who sent an army and fleet to subdue
him.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> More than Agamemnon, or any chief before
Troy,&mdash;more than Spartacus, the renowned leader of
the servile insurrection which made Rome tremble,&mdash;he
was a hero, endowed with a higher nature and better
faculties; but he was an African, jet black in complexion.
The height that he reached is the measure of his
people. Call it high-water mark, if you will; but this
is the true line for judgment, and not the low-water
mark of Slavery, which is always adopted by the apologists
for Caste. Toussaint l’Ouverture is the actual
standard by which the African must be judged.</p>

<p>When studied where he is chiefly seen,&mdash;not in the
affairs of government, but in daily life,&mdash;the African
awakens attachment and respect. The will of Mr. Upshur,
Secretary of State under President Tyler, describes
a typical character. Here are the remarkable words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I emancipate and set free my servant, David Rich, and
direct my executors to give him <i>one hundred dollars</i>. I recommend
him, in the strongest manner, to the respect, esteem,
and confidence of any community in which he may
happen to live. He has been my slave for twenty-four years,
during which time he has been trusted to every extent, and
in every respect. My confidence in him has been unbounded;
his relation to myself and family has always been such
as to afford him daily opportunities to deceive and injure us,
and yet he has never been detected in a serious fault, nor
even in an intentional breach of the decorums of his station.
His intelligence is of a high order, his integrity above all suspicion,
and his sense of right and propriety always correct
and even delicate and refined. I feel that he is justly entitled
to carry this certificate from me into the new relations
which he now must form. It is due to his long and most
faithful services, and to the sincere and steady friendship
which I bear him. In the uninterrupted and confidential
intercourse of twenty-four years, I have never given, nor had
occasion to give him, an unpleasant word. I know no man
who has fewer faults or more excellences than he.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The man thus portrayed was an African, whose only
school was Slavery. Here again is the standard of this
people.</p>

<p>Nor is there failure in loftiness of character. With
heroism more beautiful than that of Mutius Scævola,
a slave in Louisiana, as long ago as 1753, being compelled
to be executioner, cut off his right hand with
an axe, that he might avoid taking the life of his
brother slave.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The apologist for Caste will be astonished to know,
but it is none the less true, that the capacity of the
African in scholarship and science is better attested
than that of anybody claiming to be his master. What
modern slave-master has taught the Latin like Juan
Latino at Seville, in Spain,&mdash;written it like Capitein
at the Hague, or Williams at Jamaica,&mdash;gained academic
honors like those accorded to Amo by the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of Wittenberg? What modern slave-master has
equalled in science Banneker of Maryland, who, in his
admirable letter to Jefferson, avows himself “of the African
race, and in that color which is natural to them, of
the deepest dye”?<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> These instances are all from the
admirable work of the good Bishop Grégoire, “De la
Littérature des Nègres.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Recent experience attests the
singular aptitude of the African for knowledge, and his
delight in its acquisition. Nor is there any doubt of
his delight in doing good. The beneficent system of
Sunday Schools in New York is traced to an African
woman, who first attempted this work, and her school
was for all alike, without distinction of color.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>To the unquestionable capacity of the African must
be added simplicity, amenity, good-nature, generosity,
fidelity. Mahometans, who know him well, recognize
his superior fidelity. And such also is the report of
travellers not besotted by Slavery, from Mungo Park to
Livingstone, who testify also to tenderness for parents,
respect for the aged, hospitality, and patriarchal virtues
reviving the traditions of primitive life. “Strike me,
but do not curse my mother,” said an African slave to
his master.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> And Leo Africanus, the early traveller,
describes a chief at Timbuctoo, “very black in complexion,
but most fair in mind and disposition.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Others
dwell on his Christian character, and especially his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
susceptibility to those influences which are peculiarly
Christian,&mdash;so that Saint Bernard could say of him,
“<i>Felix Nigredo, quæ mentis candorem parit</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Of all
people he is the mildest and most sympathetic. Hate
is a plant of difficult growth in his bosom. How often
has he returned the harshness of his master with care
and protection! The African, more than the European,
is formed by Nature for the Christian graces.</p>

<p>It is easy to picture another age, when the virtues
which ennoble the African will return to bless the people
who now discredit him, and Christianity will receive
a new development. In the Providence of God
the more precocious and harder nature of the North is
called to make the first advance. Civilization begins
through knowledge. An active intelligence performs
the part of opening the way. But it may be according
to the same Providence, that the gentler people,
elevated in knowledge, will teach their teachers what
knowledge alone cannot impart, and the African shall
more than repay all that he receives. The pioneer intelligence
of Europe going to blend with the gentleness
of Africa will be a blessed sight, but not more blessed
than the gentleness of Africa returning to blend with
that same intelligence at home. Under such combined
influences men will not only know and do, but they
will feel also; so that knowledge in all its departments,
and life in all its activities, will have the triumphant
inspiration of Human Brotherhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this work there is no room for prejudice, timidity,
or despair. Reason, courage, and hope are our allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
while the bountiful agencies of Civilization open the
way. Time and space, ancient tyrants keeping people
apart, are now overcome. There is nothing of aspiration
for Universal Man which is not within the reach of
well-directed effort,&mdash;no matter in what unknown recess
of continent, no matter on what distant island of
the sea. Wherever Man exists, there are the capacities
of manhood, with that greatest of all, the capacity for
improvement; and the civilization we have reached supplies
the means.</p>

<p>As in determining the function of Government, so
here again is the necessity of knowledge. Man must
know himself, and that law of Unity appointed for the
Human Family. Such is the true light for our steps.
Here are guidance and safety. Who can measure the
value of knowledge? What imagination can grasp its
infinite power? As well measure the sun in its glory.
The friendly lamp in our streets is more than the police.
Light in the world is more than armies or navies.
Where its rays penetrate, there has civilization
begun. Not the earth, but the sun, is the centre of our
system; and the noon-day effulgence in which we live
and move symbolizes that other effulgence which is
found in knowledge.</p>

<p>Great powers are at hand, ministers of human progress.
I name two only: first, the printing-press; and,
secondly, the means of intercommunication, whether by
navigation or railways, represented by the steam-engine.
By these civilization is extended and secured. It is not
only carried forward, but fixed so that there can be no
return,&mdash;like the wheel of an Alpine railway, which
cannot fall back. Every rotation is a sure advance.
Here is what Greece and Rome never knew, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
than Greece and Rome have contributed to man. By
the side of these two simple agencies how small all that
has come to us from these two politest nations of Antiquity!
We can better spare Greece and Rome than
the printing-press and steam-engine. Not a triumph in
literature, art, or jurisprudence, from the story of Homer
and the odes of Horace to the statue of Apollo and
the bust of Augustus, from the eloquence of Demosthenes
and Cicero to that Roman Law which has become
the law of the world, that must not yield in value to
these two immeasurable possessions. To the printing-press
and steam-engine add now their youthful handmaid,
the electric telegraph, whose swift and delicate
fingers weave the thread by which nations are brought
into instant communion, while great cities, like London
and Paris, New York and San Francisco, become suburbs
to each other, and all mankind feel together the
throb of joy or sorrow. Through these incomparable
agencies is knowledge made coextensive with space and
time on earth. No distance of place or epoch it will
not pervade. Thus every achievement in thought or
science, every discovery by which Man is elevated, becomes
the common property of the whole Human Family.
There can be no monopoly. Sooner or later all
enjoy the triumph. Standing on the shoulders of the
Past, Man stands also on the shoulders of every science
discovered, every art advanced, every truth declared.
There is no height of culture or of virtue&mdash;if
virtue itself be not the highest culture&mdash;which may
not be reached. There is no excellence of government
or society which may not be grasped. Where is the
stopping-place? Where the goal? One obstacle is
overcome only to find another, which is overcome, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
then another also, in the ascending scale of human improvement.</p>

<p>And then shall be fulfilled the great words of prophecy,
which men have read so long with hope darkened
by despair: “The earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea”; “it shall
come that I will gather all nations and tongues, and
they shall come and see my glory.”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The promises of
Christianity, in harmony with the promises of Science,
and more beautiful still, will become the realities of
earth; and that precious example wherein is the way
of life will be another noon-day sun for guidance and
safety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question <i>How?</i> is followed by that other question
<i>When?</i> The answer is easy. Not at once; not by
any sudden conquest; not in the lifetime of any individual
man; not in any way which does not recognize
Nature as co-worker. It is by constant, incessant, unceasing
activity in conformity with law that Nature
works; and so in these world-subduing operations Man
can be successful only in harmony with Nature. Because
in our brief pilgrimage we are not permitted to
witness the transcendent glory, it is none the less certain.
The peaceful conquest will proceed, and every
day must contribute its fruits.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the last century Russia was
a barbarous country, shut out from opportunities of
improvement. Authentic report attests its condition.
Through contact with Europe it was vitalized. The
life-giving principle circulated, and this vast empire
felt the change. Exposed to European contact at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
point only, here the influence began; but the native energies
of the people, under the guidance of a powerful
ruler, responded to this influence, and Russia came
within the widening circle of European civilization.
Why may not this experience be repeated elsewhere,
and distant places feel the same beneficent power?</p>

<p>To help in this work it is not necessary to be emperor
or king. Everybody can do something, for to everybody
is given something to do; and it is by this accumulation
of activities, by this succession of atoms, that the
result is accomplished. I use trivial illustrations, when
I remind you that the coral-reef on which navies are
wrecked is the work of the multitudinous insect,&mdash;that
the unyielding stone is worn away by drops; but this is
the law of Nature, under which no influence is lost.
Water and air both testify to the slightest movement.
Not a ripple stirred by the passing breeze or by the
freighted ship cleaving the sea, which is not prolonged
to a thousand shores, leaving behind an endless progeny,
so long as ocean endures. Not a wave of air set in
motion by the human voice, which is not prolonged
likewise into unknown space. But these watery and
aërial pulses typify the acts of Man. Not a thing done,
not a word said, which does not help or hinder the
grand, the beautiful, the holy consummation. And the
influence is in proportion to the individual or nation
from whom it proceeds. God forbid that our nation
should send through all time that defiance of human
nature which is found in Caste!</p>

<p>There are two passages of the New Testament which
are to me of infinite significance. We read them often,
perhaps, without comprehending their value. The first
is with regard to leaven, when the Saviour said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> “The
kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven”;<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and then
Saint Paul, taking up the image, on two different occasions,
repeats, “A little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump.”<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In this homely illustration we see what is accomplished
by a small influence. A little changes all.
Here again are the acts of Man typified. All that we
do is leaven; all that our country does is leaven.
Everybody in his sphere contributes leaven, and helps
his country to contribute that mighty leaven which will
leaven the whole mighty lump. The other passage&mdash;difficult
to childhood, though afterwards recognized as a
faithful record of human experience&mdash;is where we are
told, “For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and
he shall have more abundance.”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Here to me is a new
incentive to duty. Because the world inclines to those
who have, therefore must we study to serve those who
have not, that we may counteract the worldly tendency.
Give to the poor and lowly, give to the outcast, give to
those degraded by their fellow-men, that they may be
elevated in the scale of Humanity,&mdash;assured that what
we give is not only valuable in itself, but the beginning
of other acquisitions,&mdash;that the knowledge we convey
makes other knowledge easy,&mdash;that the right we recognize
helps to secure all the Rights of Man. Give to
the African only his due, and straightway the promised
abundance will follow.</p>

<p>In leaving this question, which I have opened to you
so imperfectly, I am impressed anew with its grandeur.
The best interests of our country and the best interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of mankind are involved in the answer. Let Caste prevail,
and Civilization is thwarted. Let Caste be trampled
out, and there will be a triumph which will make
this Republic more than ever an example. The good
influence will extend in prolonged pulsations, reaching
the most distant shores. Not a land which will not feel
the spread, just in proportion to its necessities. Above
all, Africa will feel it; and the surpassing duty which
Civilization owes to this whole continent, where man
has so long degraded his fellow-man, will begin to be
discharged, while the voice of the Great Shepherd is
heard among its people.</p>

<p>In the large interests beyond, I would not lose sight
of the practical interests at home. It is important for
our domestic peace, not to speak of our good name as a
Republic, that this question should be settled. Long
enough has its shadow rested upon us, and now it lowers
from an opposite quarter. How often have I said in
other places that nothing can be settled which is not
right! And now I say that there can be no settlement
here except in harmony with our declared principles
and with universal truth. To this end Caste must be
forbidden. “Haply for I am black,” said Othello;
“Haply for I am yellow,” repeats the Chinese: all of
which may be ground for personal like or dislike, but
not for any denial of rights, or any exclusion from that
equal copartnership which is the promise of the Republic
to all men.</p>

<p>Here, as always, the highest safety is in doing right.
Justice is ever practical, ever politic; it is the best
practice, the best policy. Whatever reason shows to be
just cannot, when reduced to practice, produce other
than good. And now I simply ask you to be just. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
those who find peril in the growing multitudes admitted
to citizenship I reply, that our Republic assumed these
responsibilities when it declared the equal rights of all
men, and that just government stands only on the consent
of the governed. Hospitality of citizenship is the
law of its being. This is its great first principle; this
is the talisman of its empire. Would you conquer
Nature, follow Nature; and here, would you conquer
physical diversities, follow that moral law declared by
our fathers, which is the highest law of Nature, and
supreme above all men. Welcome, then, to the stranger
hurrying from opposite shores, across two great
oceans,&mdash;from the East, from the West,&mdash;with the
sun, against the sun! Here he cannot be stranger. If
the Chinese come for labor only, we have the advantage
of their wonderful and docile industry. If they come
for citizenship, then do they offer the pledge of incorporation
in our Republic, filling it with increase. Nor is
there peril in the gifts they bring. As all rivers are
lost in the sea, which shows no sign of their presence,
so will all peoples be lost in the widening confines of
our Republic, with an ocean-bound continent for its
unparalleled expanse, and one harmonious citizenship,
where all are equal in rights, for its gentle and impartial
sway.</p>

bill to the Committee on Finance; and if I can

for his consideration seven different reasons in favor
of it. It will take me only one minute.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</i>, That so much of the Banking Act as limits the issue
of bills to $300,000,000 is hereby repealed, and existing banks may be enlarged
and new banks may be organized at the discretion of the Secretary
of the Treasury; but no more bills than are now authorized by the Banking
Act shall hereafter be issued, unless the Secretary of the Treasury, at
the time of their issue, can and does cancel and destroy a like amount of
legal-tenders; and the increase of bank-bills hereby authorized shall not
exceed $50,000,000 a year, which amount shall be so distributed by the
Secretary of the Treasury as to equalize, as near as possible, the banking
interest of the different States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Now, Mr. President, I wish at this
moment merel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>y to indicate the reasons in favor of that
proposition.</p>

<p>1. It will create a demand for national bonds, and to
this extent fortify the national credit.</p>

<p>2. It will tend to satisfy those parts of the country,
especially at the South and West, where currency and
banks are wanting, and thus arrest a difficult question.</p>

<p>3. It will not expand or contract the currency; so
that the opposite parties on these questions may support
it.</p>

<p>4. Under it the banks will gradually strengthen
themselves and prepare to resume specie payments.</p>

<p>5. It will give the South and West the opportunity
to organize banks, and will interest those parts of
the country to this extent in the national securities
and the national banking system, by which both will
be strengthened.</p>

<p>6. It will within a reasonable time relieve the country
of the whole greenback system, and thus dispose of
an important question.</p>

<p>7. It will hasten the return to specie payments.</p>

<p>Now I believe every one of these reasons is valid,
and I commend them to my excellent friend from
Ohio.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolution and Remarks in the Senate, on the Exclusion
of Colored Physicians from the Medical Society of
the District of Columbia, December 9, 1869.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I offer the following resolution, and ask for its immediate
consideration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the District of Columbia
be directed to consider the expediency of repealing the charter
of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia,
and of such other legislation as may be necessary in order
to secure for medical practitioners in the District of Columbia
equal rights and opportunities without distinction of
color.</p>

</div>

<p>I hope there can be no objection to this proposition,
which has become necessary from a recent incident. A
medical practitioner in Washington, Dr. Augusta, who
had served as a surgeon in the Army of the United
States and was brevetted as a Lieutenant-Colonel, who
had enjoyed office and honor under the National Government,
has been excluded from the Medical Society of
the District of Columbia on that old reason so often and
persistently urged, merely of color. It is true that Dr.
Augusta is guilty of a skin which is a shade different
from that prevailing in the Medical Society, but nobody
can impeach his character or his professional position.
Dr. Purvis, another practitioner, obnoxious only fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>m
the skin, was excluded at the same time. There is no
doubt that this was accomplished by an organized effort,
quickened by color-phobia.</p>

<p>This exclusion, besides its stigma on a race, is a practical
injury to these gentlemen, and to their patients
also, who are thus shut out from valuable opportunities
and advantages. By a rule of the Medical Society,
“No member of this association shall consult with or
meet in a professional way any resident practitioner
of the District who is not a member thereof, after
said practitioner shall have resided six months in said
District.” Thus do members of the Society constitute
themselves a medical oligarchy. When asked to consult
with Dr. Augusta, some of them have replied:
“We would like to consult with Dr. Augusta; we believe
him to be a good doctor; but he does not belong
to our Society, and therefore we must decline; but we
will take charge of the case”: and this has been sometimes
done. Is not this a hardship? Should it be allowed
to exist?</p>

<p>Details illustrate still further the character of this
wrong. These colored practitioners are licensed, like
members of the Society; but this license does not give
them the privilege of attending the meetings of the Society,
where medical and surgical subjects are discussed,
and where peculiar and interesting cases with their appropriate
treatment are communicated for the benefit of
the profession; so that they are shut out from this interesting
source of information, which is like a constant
education, and also from the opportunity of submitting
the cases in their own practice.</p>

<p>I confess, Sir, that I cannot think of the medical profession
at the National Capital engaged in this warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
on their colored brethren without sentiments which it is
difficult to restrain. Their conduct, in its direct effect,
degrades a long-suffering and deeply injured race; but
it also degrades themselves. Nobody can do such a
meanness without degradation. In my opinion these
white oligarchs ought to have notice, and I give them
notice now, that this outrage shall not be allowed to
continue without remedy, if I can obtain it through
Congress. The time has passed for any such pretension.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, there can be no objection to the resolution.
It ought to pass unanimously. Who will array
himself on the side of this wrong?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was agreed to, and the Committee proceeded to a full
investigation, of which they made extended report,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> accompanied by a

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;A seat in this Chamber is vacant.
But this is a very inadequate expression
for the present occasion. Much more than a seat is vacant.
There is a void difficult to measure, as it will be
difficult to fill. Always eminent from the beginning,
Mr. Fessenden during these latter years became so large
a part of the Senate that without him it seems to be a
different body. His guiding judgment, his ready power,
his presence so conspicuous in debate, are gone, taking
away from this Chamber that identity which it received
so considerably from him.</p>

<p>Of all the present Senate, one only besides myself
witnessed his entry into this Chamber. I cannot forget
it. He came in the midst of that terrible debate on the
Kansas and Nebraska Bill by which the country was
convulsed to its centre, and his arrival had the effect of
a reinforcement on a field of battle. Those who stood
for Freedom then were few in numbers,&mdash;not more
than fourteen,&mdash;while thirty-seven Senators in solid
column voted to break the faith originally plighted to
Freedom, and to overturn a time-honored landmark,
opening that vast Mesopotamian region to the curse of
Slavery. Those anxious days are with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> difficulty comprehended
by a Senate where Freedom rules. One
more in our small number was a sensible addition.
We were no longer fourteen, but fifteen. His reputation
at the bar and his fame in the other House gave
assurance which was promptly sustained. He did not
wait, but at once entered into the debate with all those
resources which afterwards became so famous. The
scene that ensued exhibited his readiness and courage.
While saying that the people of the North were fatigued
with the threat of Disunion, that they considered
it as “mere noise and nothing else,” he was interrupted
by Mr. Butler, of South Carolina, always ready
to speak for Slavery, exclaiming, “If such sentiments
as yours prevail, I want a dissolution right away,”&mdash;a
characteristic intrusion doubly out of order,&mdash;to which
the new-comer rejoined, “Do not delay it on my account;
do not delay it on account of anybody at the
North.” The effect was electric; but this instance was
not alone. Douglas, Cass, and Butler interrupted only
to be worsted by one who had just ridden into the lists.
The feelings of the other side were expressed by the
Senator from South Carolina, who, after one of the
flashes of debate which he had provoked, exclaimed:
“Very well, go on; I have no hope for you.” All this
will be found in the “Globe,”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> precisely as I give it;
but the “Globe” could not picture the exciting scene,&mdash;the
Senator from Maine erect, firm, immovable as a
jutting promontory against which the waves of Ocean
tossed and broke in dissolving spray. There he stood.
Not a Senator, loving Freedom, who did not feel on that
day that a champion had come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>This scene, so brilliant in character, illustrates Mr.
Fessenden’s long career in the Senate. All present
were moved, while those at a distance were less affected.
His speech, which was argumentative, direct,
and pungent, exerted more influence on those who
heard it than on those who only read it, vindicating
his place as debater rather than orator. This place he
held to the end, without a superior,&mdash;without a peer.
Nobody could match him in immediate and incisive
reply. His words were swift, and sharp as a cimeter,&mdash;or,
borrowing an illustration from an opposite quarter,
he “shot flying” and with unerring aim. But
while this great talent secured for him always the first
honors of debate, it was less important with the country,
which, except in rare instances, is more impressed
by ideas and by those forms in which truth is manifest.</p>

<p>The Senate has changed much from its original character,
when, shortly after the formation of the National
Government, a Nova Scotia paper, in a passage copied
by one of our own journals, while declaring that “the
habits of the people here are very favorable to oratory,”
could say, “There is but one assembly in the whole
range of the Federal Union in which eloquence is
deemed unnecessary, and, I believe, even absurd and
obtrusive,&mdash;to wit, the Senate, or upper house of
Congress. They are merely a deliberative meeting, in
which every man delivers his concise opinion, one leg
over the other, as they did in the first Congress, where
an harangue was a great rarity.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Speech was th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>en for
business and immediate effect in the Chamber. Since
then the transformation has proceeded, speech becoming
constantly more important, until now, without neglect
of business, the Senate has become a centre from
which to address the country. A seat here is a lofty
pulpit with a mighty sounding-board, and the whole
wide-spread people is the congregation.</p>

<p>As Mr. Fessenden rarely spoke except for business,
what he said was restricted in its influence, but it was
most effective in this Chamber. Here was his empire,
and his undisputed throne. Of perfect integrity and
austerest virtue, he was inaccessible to those temptations
which in various forms beset the avenues of public
life. Most faithfully and constantly did he watch
the interests intrusted to him. Here he was a model.
Holding the position of Chairman of the Finance Committee,
while it yet had those double duties which are
now divided between two important committees, he became
the guardian of the National Treasury, both in its
receipts and its expenditures, so that nothing was added
to it or taken from it without his knowledge; and
how truly he discharged this immense trust all will attest.
Nothing could leave the Treasury without showing
a passport. This service was the more momentous
from the magnitude of the transactions involved; for it
was during the whole period of the war, when appropriations
responded to loans and taxes,&mdash;all being on
a scale beyond precedent in the world’s history. On
these questions, sometimes so sensitive and difficult
and always so grave, his influence was beyond that of
any other Senator and constantly swayed the Senate.
All that our best generals were in arms he was in the
financial field.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>Absorbed in his great duties, and confined too much
by the training of a profession which too often makes
its follower slave where he is not master, he forgot
sometimes that championship which shone so brightly
when he first entered the Senate. Ill-health came with
its disturbing influence, and, without any of the nature
of Hamlet, his conduct at times suggested those words
by which Hamlet pictures the short-comings of life.
Too often, in his case, “the native hue of resolution
was sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought”; and
perhaps I might follow the words of Shakespeare further,
and picture “enterprises of great pith and moment,”
which, “with this regard, their currents turned
awry and lost the name of action.”</p>

<p>Men are tempted by the talent which they possess;
and he could not resist the impulse to employ, sometimes
out of place, those extraordinary powers which he
commanded so easily. More penetrating than grasping,
he easily pierced the argument of his opponent, and,
once engaged, he yielded to the excitement of the moment
and the joy of conflict. His words warmed, as
the Olympic wheel caught fire in the swiftness of the
race. If on these occasions there were sparkles which
fell where they should not have fallen, they cannot be
remembered now. Were he still among us, face to face,
it were better to say, in the words of that earliest recorded
reconciliation,&mdash;</p>

<p>“That in the opinion of the Senate the thirty gun-boats purchased or

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I shall interpose no objection to that; but I feel it
my duty to suggest that it does seem to me that a
discussion of that question is premature, and for this
reason: there is no information with regard to those
gun-boats now before the Senate, except what we derive
from the newspapers. I understand that the Department
of State will in a few days, as soon as the
documents can be copied, communicate to the Senate
all that it has with reference to our relations with
Cuba, which will probably cover the question of the
gun-boats. There is a question of fact and of law, and
I for one am indisposed to approach its discussion until
I have all the information now in the possession of the
Government. At the same time my friend from Wisconsin
will understand that I have no disposition to interfere
with any desires he may have. If he wishes,
therefore, to go <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>on, I shall content myself with the suggestions
that I have made.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Carpenter’s motion prevailing, he proceeded with an argument
in support of the resolution in question, to which Mr. Sumner replied
as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator from Wisconsin closed
by saying that he understood that eighteen of the gun-boats
would leave to-morrow. I have had put into my
hands a telegram received last night from New York,
which I will read, as it relates to that subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The vessels delivered by Delamater to the representatives
of the Spanish Navy have their officers and crews on
board and fly the flag of Spain. They are now as completely
the property of that Government as is the Pizarro. Unless
something not foreseen occurs, they will be at sea to-morrow
morning, if not already gone.”</p>

</div>

<p>“To-morrow morning” is this morning.</p>

<p>But there are eight other boats, that are still unfinished,
on the stocks, to which the resolution of the
Senator from Wisconsin is applicable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have no disposition now to discuss the great question
involved in the speech of the Senator from Wisconsin;
but the Senator will pardon me, if I venture to
suggest that he has misapprehended the meaning of the
statute on which he relies. Certainly he has misapprehended
it or I have. He has misapprehended it or the
Administration has. I do not conceive that the question
which he has presented can arise under the statute.
The language on which he relies is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any person shall within the limits of the United States
fit out and arm, or attempt to fit out and arm, or procure to
be fitted out and armed, or shall knowingly be concerned in
the furnishing, fitting out, or arming of any ship or vessel,
with intent that such ship or vessel shall be employed in the
service of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district,
or people, to cruise or commit hostilities against the
subjects, citizens, or property of any foreign prince or state,
or of any colony, district, or people, with whom the United
States are at peace,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The operative words on which the Senator relies being
“any colony, district, or people,” I understand the
Senator to insist that under these words Spain cannot
purchase ships in the United States to cruise against
her Cuban subjects now in revolt. That is the position
of the Senator. He states it frankly. To that I specifically
reply, that the language of the statute is entirely
inapplicable. Those words, if the Senator will consult
their history, were introduced for a specific purpose. It
was to meet the case of the revolted Spanish colonies
already for eight years in arms against the parent Government,
having ships in every sea, largely possessing
the territories on the Spanish main, and with independence
nearly achieved.</p>

<p>There was no question of belligerence. It was admitted
by all the civilized world. Nation after nation
practically recognized it. Our Government, our courts,
every department of the Government, recognized the
belligerence of those Spanish colonies. Their independence
was recognized more tardily, after ample discussion
in these two Chambers as late as 1820; but their
belligerence was a fact perfectly established and recognized
by every branch of the Government. To meet
their case, and for no other object, as I understand i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>t,
Mr. Miller, a Representative of South Carolina, on the
30th day of December, 1817, introduced the following
resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee be appointed to inquire into
the expediency of so amending the fourth section of the Act
passed on the 3d of March, 1817, entitled ‘An Act more
effectually to preserve the neutral relations of the United
States,’ as to embrace within the provisions thereof the
armed vessels of a Government at peace with the United
States and at war with any colony, district, or people with
whom the United States are or may be at peace.”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The important words “any colony, district, or people”
were introduced to cover the precise case of the
revolted Spanish colonies and their precise condition at
that moment, there being no question of belligerence.
Now the practical question is, whether these words, introduced
originally for a specific purpose, having an historic
character beyond question, can be extended so as
to be applied to insurgents who have not yet achieved
a corporate existence,&mdash;who have no provinces, no cities,
no towns, no ports, no prize courts. Such is the
fact. I cannot supply the fact, if it does not exist; nor
can the Senator, with his eloquence and with his ardor
enlisted in this cause. We must seek the truth. The
truth is found in the actual facts. Now do those facts
justify the concession which the Senator requires?</p>

<p>The Cuban insurgents, whatever the inspiration of
their action, have not reached the condition of belligerents.
Such, I repeat, is the fact, and we cannot alter
the fact. Here we must rely upon the evidence, which,
according to all the information within my reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> is adverse.
They do not come within any of the prerequisites.
They have no provinces, no towns, no ports, no
prize courts. Without these I am at a loss to see how
they can be treated as belligerents by foreign powers.
Before this great concession there must be assurance of
their capacity to administer justice. Above all, there
must be a Prize Court. But nobody pretends that there
is any such thing.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Will the Senator now allow me to ask
him one question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> My question is, if it be not the most
favorable opportunity to obtain the facts to libel those boats
and get proof on the question?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator will pardon me, if I say
I do not think it is. I think that the better way of ascertaining
the facts is to send to our authorized agents
in Cuba,&mdash;we have consuls at every considerable place,&mdash;and
direct them to report on the facts. I understand
such reports have been received by the Department
of State. They will be communicated to the
Senate. They are expected day by day, and they are
explicit, unless I have been misinformed, on this single
point,&mdash;that, whatever may be the inspiration of that
insurrection, it has not yet reached that condition of
maturity, that corporate character, which in point of
fact makes it belligerent in character.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span> I do not wish to interrupt the Senator,
but I should like to ask a question at this point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span> I wish for information on this subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and I think we all stand in need of it; and I should be very
much obliged to the Senator from Massachusetts, if he is
able to do so, if he would give us a statement of the amount
of military force actually in the field in Cuba, or the amount
of force that is available; and whether the insurgents have
established a civil government for themselves,&mdash;whether it
be or be not in operation as a government. On these subjects
I confess my ignorance.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator confesses we are in the
dark, and on this account I consider the debate premature.
We all need information, and I understand it
will be supplied by the Department of State. There
is information on the precise point to which the Senator
calls attention, and that is as to the number of the
forces on both sides. I understand on the side of the
insurgents it has latterly very much diminished; and I
have been told that they are now little more than <i>guerrilleros</i>,
and that the war they are carrying on is little
more than a guerrilla contest,&mdash;that they are not in
possession of any town or considerable place. Such is
my information.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span> Have they any government?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understand they have the government
that is in a camp. With regard to that the Senator
knows as well as I; but that brings us back again
to the necessity of information.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span> Any civil government, any legislative power
for the actual exercise of legislative functions?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I think there is no evidence that t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>here
is a legislative body; and I must say I await with great
anxiety the evidence of their action on the subject of
Slavery itself. What assurance have we that slavery
will be terminated by these insurgents? Have they the
will? Have they the power? I know the report that
they have abolished slavery, but this report leaves much
to be desired. I wish it to be authenticated and relieved
from all doubt. It is said that there are two decrees,&mdash;one
to be read at home, and another to be read abroad.
Is this true? And even if not true, is there any assurance
that the insurrectionists are able to make this decree
good? But while I require the surrender of slavery
from the insurrectionists, I make the same requirement
of Spain. Why has this power delayed?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> I ask the Senator if Spain has not recently
affirmed the existence of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico,
especially in Porto Rico, by publishing a new constitution
guarantying the existence of slavery?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am not able to inform the Senator
precisely on that point. I do know enough, however,
to satisfy me that Spain is a laggard on this question;
and if my voice could reach her now, it would plead
with her to be quick, to make haste to abolish slavery,
not only in Cuba, but in Porto Rico. Its continued existence
is a shame, and it should cease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have no disposition to go into this subject at length.
There is, however, one other remark that the Senator
from Wisconsin made to which I shall be justified in
replying. He alludes to the case of the Hornet, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
proceedings against that vessel.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It is not for me now
to vindicate those proceedings. They may have been
proper under the statute, or may not; but it is very
clear to me that the cases of the Hornet and the Spanish
gun-boats are plainly distinguishable, and, if the
Senate will pardon me one moment, I will make the
distinction, I think, perfectly apparent. We all know
that two or three or four or a dozen persons may levy
war against the Government, may levy war against
the king. A traitor levies war against the king. The
king, when he proceeds against the traitor, does not
levy war. He simply proceeds in the exercise of his
executive functions in order to establish his authority.
And in the spirit of this illustration I am disposed to
believe that the United States were perfectly justifiable,
even under this statute, in arresting the Hornet; but
they would not be justifiable in arresting the Spanish
gun-boats. The Hornet was levying war against
Spain, and therefore subject to arrest. The gun-boats
are levying no war, simply because the insurrection
against which they are to be used has not reached the
condition of war.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask one
other question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> What I want to know is this: whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the condition of neutrality does not necessarily depend upon
the fact that war is progressing between two parties? Can
there be any neutrality, unless there is a contest of arms going
on between two somebodies? Now, if it be a violation
of our Neutrality Act for one of those bodies to come in and
fit out vessels in the United States, is it not equally so for
the other?&mdash;or is our pretence of neutrality a falsehood,
a cheat, and a delusion?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Mr. President, I do not regard it as a
question of neutrality. Until the belligerence of these
people is recognized, they are not of themselves a power,
they are not a people. Therefore there can be no
neutrality on the part of our Government between
Spain and her revolted subjects, until they come up
to the condition of a people. They have not reached
that point; and therefore I submit that there is at this
moment no question of neutrality, and that the argument
of the Senator in that respect was inapplicable.
When the belligerence of the insurgents is recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>d
there will be a case for neutrality, and not before.</p>

<h2><a name="ADMISSION_OF_VIRGINIA_TO_REPRESENTATION" id="ADMISSION_OF_VIRGINIA_TO_REPRESENTATION"></a>ADMISSION OF VIRGINIA TO REPRESENTATION
IN CONGRESS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, January 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21,
1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 10, 1870, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of a
Joint Resolution reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, declaring,
“That the State of Virginia is entitled to representation in
the Congress of the United States,”&mdash;she having, as was said, “complied
in all respects with the Reconstruction Acts.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, apprehending that this compliance had been merely
formal, and that the Rebel spirit was still the dominant influence in
Virginia, urged postponement of the measure for a few days, to afford
opportunity for information, remarking:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am assured that there are resolutions of public
meetings in different parts of Virginia, that there
are papers, letters, communications, all tending to throw
light on the actual condition of things in that State,
which in the course of a short time, of a few days at
furthest, will be presented to the Senate. Under these
circumstances, I submit most respectfully, and without
preferring any request with reference to myself, that
the measure should be allowed to go over for a few
days, perhaps for a week, till Monday next, and that it
then should be taken up and proceeded with to the end.
My object is, that, when the Senate acts on this important
measure, it may act wisely, with adequate knowledge,
and so that hereafter it may have no occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
regret its conclusion. How many are there now, Sir,
who, on the information in our papers to-day, would
not recall the vote by which Tennessee was declared
entitled to her place as a State! You, Sir, have read
that report signed by the Representatives of Tennessee,
and by her honored Senator here on my right [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Brownlow</span>]. From that you will see the condition of
things in that State at this moment. Is there not a lesson,
Sir, in that condition of things? Does it not teach
us to be cautious before we commit this great State of
Virginia back to the hands of the people that have
swayed it in war against the National Government?
Sir, this is a great responsibility. I am anxious that
the Senate should exercise it only after adequate knowledge
and inquiry. I do not believe that they have the
means at this moment of coming to a proper determination.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After extended debate, Mr. Sumner’s proposition finally took shape
in a motion by his colleague [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>] to postpone the further
consideration of the resolution for three days. In response to Mr.
Stewart, of Nevada, who had charge of the measure, and who insisted
that “no one had been able to find a reason worthy of consideration
why they should not proceed and act affirmatively at once,” Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;It seems to me that this discussion
to-day tends irresistibly to one conclusion,&mdash;that
the Senate is not now prepared to act. I do not say
that it will not be prepared in one, two, or three days,
or in a week; but it is not now prepared to act. Not a
Senator has spoken, either on one side or the other, who
has not made points of law, some of them presented for
the first time in this Chamber. Hardly a Senator has
spoken who has not presented questions of fact. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>How
are we to determine these? Time is essential. We
must be able to look into the papers, to examine the
evidence, and, if my friend will pardon me, to examine
also the law, to see whether the conclusion on which he
stands so firmly is one on which the Senate can plant
itself forevermore. The Senator must bear in mind that
what we do now with reference to Virginia we do permanently
and irrepealably, and that we affect the interests
of that great State, and I submit also the safety of
a large portion of its population. Sir, I am not willing
to go forward in haste and in ignorance to deal with
so great a question. Let us consider it, let us approach
it carefully, and give to it something of that attention
which the grandeur of the interest involved requires.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, the suggestion of my colleague,
that this matter be postponed for several days, is proper;
it is only according to the ordinary course of business
of the Senate, and it is sustained by manifest reason
in this particular case. I should prefer that the
postponement were till next Monday, and I will be precise
in assigning my reason. It is nothing personal to
myself. My friend from New York said, or intimated,
that, if the Senator from Massachusetts wished to be
accommodated, he would be ready, of course, to consent
to gratify him. Now I would not have it placed on
that ground; I present it as a question of business;
and I, as a Senator interested in the decision of this
business, wish to have time to peruse these papers and
to obtain that knowledge which will enable me to
decide ultimately on the case. I have not now the
knowledge that I desire with reference to the actual
condition of things in Virginia. I am assured by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
in whom I place confidence that in the course of a few
days that evidence will be forthcoming. Will not the
Senate receive it? Will it press hastily, heedlessly,
recklessly, to a conclusion, which, when reached, it may
hereafter find occasion to regret? Let us, Sir, so act
that we shall have hereafter no regrets; let us so act
that the people of Virginia hereafter may be safe, and
that they may express their gratitude to the Congress of
the United States which has helped to protect them.</p>

<p>The Senator from Nevada said, that, if we oppose the
present bill, we sacrifice the Legislature of the State.
I suggest to that Senator, that, if we do not oppose this
bill, we sacrifice the people of the State. What, Sir, is
a Legislature chosen as this recent Legislature has been
chosen in Virginia, composed of recent Rebels still filled
and seething with that old Rebel fire,&mdash;what is that
Legislature in the scale, compared with the safety of
that great people? Sir, I put in one scale the welfare
of the State of Virginia, the future security of its large
population, historic and memorable in our annals, and
in the other scale I put a Legislature composed of recent
Rebels. To save that Legislature the Senator from
Nevada presses forward to sacrifice the people of the
State.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion to postpone was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 25, Nays 26,&mdash;and
the debate on the Joint Resolution proceeded: the first question being
on an amendment offered by Mr. Drake, of Missouri, providing that
the passage by the Legislature of Virginia, at any time thereafter, of
any act or resolution rescinding or annulling its ratification of the Fifteenth
Article of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
should operate to exclude the State from representation in Congress
and remand it to its former provisional government.</p>

<p>January 11th, Mr. Sumner, following Mr. Morton, of Indiana, in
support of Mr. Drake’s proposed amendment, and, with him, maintaining
the continued power of Congress over a State after reconstruction,
sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>id:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I have but one word to say, and it
is one of gratitude to the Senator from Indiana for the
complete adhesion he now makes to a principle of Constitutional
Law which I have no doubt is unassailable.
The Congress of the United States will have forevermore
the power to protect Reconstruction. No one of
these States, by anything that it may do hereafter, can
escape from that far-reaching power. I call it far-reaching:
it will reach just as far as the endeavor to counteract
it; it is coextensive with the Constitution itself. I
have no doubt of it, and I am delighted that the distinguished
Senator from Indiana has given to it the support
of his authority.</p>

<p>While I feel so grateful to my friend from Indiana
for what he has said on this point, he will allow me to
express my dissent from another proposition of his. He
says that we are now bound under our Reconstruction
Acts to admit Virginia. I deny it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Will the Senator allow me one moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> I do not pretend that there is any clause
in the Reconstruction Acts which in express words requires
us to admit Virginia upon the compliance with certain conditions;
but what I mean to say is, that there went forth with
those laws an understanding to the country, as clear and distinct
as if it had been written in the statute, that upon a full
and honorable compliance with them those States should be
admitted. I will ask my friend from Massachusetts if that
understanding did not exist?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> My answer to the Senator is found in
the last section of the Act authorizing the submiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ion,
of the Constitutions of these States, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the proceedings in any of said States shall not be
deemed final, or operate as a complete restoration thereof,
until their action respectively shall be approved by Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What is the meaning of that? The whole case is
brought before Congress for consideration. We are to
look into it, and consider the circumstances under which
these elections have taken place, and see whether we
can justly give to them our approval. Is that vain language?
Was it not introduced for a purpose? Was it
merely for show? Was it for deception? Was it a
cheat? No, Sir; it was there with a view to a practical
result, to meet precisely the case now before the
Senate,&mdash;that is, a seeming compliance with the requirements
of our Reconstruction policy, but a failure
in substance.</p>

<p>Now I will read what was in the bill of March 2,
1867, entitled “An Act to provide for the more efficient
government of the Rebel States.”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It declares in the
preamble that “it is necessary that peace and good order
should be enforced in said States,”&mdash;strong language
that!&mdash;“until loyal and republican State governments
can be legally established.” That is what
Congress is to require. To that end Congress must
look into the circumstances of the case; it must consider
what the condition of the people there is,&mdash;whether
this new government is loyal, whether it is
in the hands of loyal people. To that duty Congress
is summoned by its very legislation; the duty is laid
down in advance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>And so you may go through all these Reconstruction
statutes, and you will find that under all of them the
whole subject is brought back ultimately to the discretion
of Congress. This whole subject now is in the discretion
of Congress. I trust that Congress will exercise
it so that life and liberty and property shall be safe.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 12th, Mr. Sumner presented a memorial from citizens of
Virginia then in Washington, claiming to represent the loyal people
of that State, in which they declare themselves “anxious for the
prompt admission of the State to representation upon such terms
that a loyal civil government may be maintained and the rights of
loyal men secured; which,” they say, “we feel assured cannot be the
case, if any condition less than the application of the test oath to the
Legislature shall be imposed by the Congress.” As the grounds of this
conviction, they point, among other matters, to the continued manifestations
of the Rebel spirit in the community,&mdash;the ascendency of
the Rebel party in the recently elected Legislature, gained, as they insist,
“by intimidation, fraud, violence, and prevention of free speech,”&mdash;and
particularly to the evidences of disloyalty, and of meditated bad
faith in regard to the new State Constitution, exhibited in speeches
and other utterances of the Governor and Members of Assembly,&mdash;utterances,
on the part of some of the latter, accompanied with gross
contumely of a distinguished Member of Congress from Massachusetts:
all of which, the memorialists say, “if a hearing can now be had, and
which we respectfully request may be granted, we pledge ourselves
to show by sworn witnesses of irreproachable character, residing in
Virginia.”</p>

<p>The memorial was received with denunciation, as “disrespectful,”
“unjust and abusive,” “merely the wailing of those who were defeated,”
“originating with the view of keeping out Virginia,” “trifling
with our own plighted faith and honor,”&mdash;and its presentation criticized
with corresponding severity,&mdash;the Senators from Nevada leading
the assault. Mr. Sumner responded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;Has it come to this, that the loyal
people of Virginia cannot be heard on this floor? that a
petition presented by a member of this body, proceeding
from them, is to have first the denunciation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Senator from Nevada on my right [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>], and then
the denunciation of the Senator from Nevada on my
left [Mr. <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>]? Why are the loyal people of Virginia
to be thus exposed? What have they done? Sir,
in what respect is that petition open to exception? The
Senator says it is disrespectful. To whom? To this
body? To the other Chamber? To the President of
the United States? To any branch of this Government?
Not in the least. It is disrespectful, according
to the Senator from Nevada, to the present Governor of
Virginia, and he undertakes to state his case.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I have nothing to say of the present Governor
of Virginia. I am told that he is on this floor;
but I have not the honor of his acquaintance, and I
know very little about him. I make no allegation, no
suggestion, with regard to his former course. He may
have been as sound always as the Senator from Nevada
himself; but the petitioners from Virginia say the contrary.
They are so circumstanced as to know more
about him than the Senator from Nevada, or than myself;
and they are so circumstanced as to have a great
stake in his future conduct. Thus circumstanced, they
send their respectful petition to this Chamber, asking a
hearing; and what is the answer? Denunciation from
one Senator of Nevada echoed by denunciation from the
other Senator of Nevada. The voice of Nevada on this
occasion is united, it is one, to denounce a loyal petition
from Virginia.</p>

<p>Was I not right in presenting the petition? Shall
these people be unheard? The Committee which the
Senator represents, led by the Senator from Illinois [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], and now led by himself, are pressing this
measure to a precipitate conclusion. These petitioners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
having this great interest in the result, ask for a hearing.
Several days ago I presumed, respectfully, deferentially,
to ask that this measure should be postponed
a few days in order to give an opportunity for such a
hearing. I was refused. The Senator from Nevada
would not consent, and with the assistance of Democrats
he crowds this measure forward. Sir, it is natural,
allow me to say, that one acting in this new conjunction
should trifle with the right of petition. When
one begins to act with such allies, I can well imagine
that he loses something of his original devotion to the
great fundamental principles of our Government.</p>

<p>Something was said by my friend, the other Senator
from Nevada [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>], on another passage of the petition,
referring to a distinguished colleague of my own.
Why, Sir, that very passage furnishes testimony against
the cause represented by the Senator from Nevada. It
shows how little to be trusted are these men. It shows
the game of treachery which they have undertaken. It
shows how they are intending to press this measure
through Congress so as to obtain for Virginia the independence
of a State. Are you ready for that conclusion?
Are you ready to part with this great control
which yet remains to Congress, through which security
may be maintained for the rights of all?</p>

<p>Something has been said by different Senators of
plighted faith. Sir, there is a faith that is plighted,
and by that I will stand, God willing, to the end. It
is nothing less than this: to secure the rights of all,
without distinction of color, in the State of Virginia.
When I can secure those rights, when I can see that
they are firmly established beyond the reach of fraud,
beyond the violence of opposition, then I am willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
that that State shall again assume its independent position.
But until then I say, Wait! In the name of Justice,
in the name of Liberty, for the sake of Human
Rights, I entreat the Senate to wait.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 13th, in response to criticisms by Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It was in pursuance of the effort I made on the first
day of this week that yesterday I presented a memorial
from loyal citizens of Virginia here in Washington. I
presented it as a memorial, and asked to have it read.
The Senator from Nevada [Mr. <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>], in the remarks
which he so kindly made with regard to me later
in the day, said that in asking to have it read I adopted
it. I can pardon that remark to the Senator from Nevada,
who is less experienced in this Chamber than the
Senator from Illinois; but the latter Senator has repeated
substantially the same remark. Sir, this is a new
position, that in presenting a memorial one adopts it,
especially when he asks to have it read. Why, Sir,
what is the right of petition? Is it reduced to this,
that no petition can be presented unless the Senator
approves it, or that no petition can be read at the request
of a Senator unless he approves it? Such a limitation
on the right of petition would go far to cut it
down to its unhappy condition in those pro-slavery
days which some of us remember. Sir, I was right
in presenting the memorial, and right in asking to
have it read.</p>

<p>And now what is its character? It sets forth a condition
of things in Virginia which might well make the
Senate pause. I think no candid person can have listened
to that memorial without seeing that it contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
statements with regard to which the Senate ought to be
instructed before it proceeds to a vote. Do you consider,
Sir, that when you install this Legislature you consign
the people of Virginia to its power? Do you consider
that to this body belongs the choice of judges?
The whole judiciary of the State is to be organized by
it. This may be done in the interests of Freedom and
Humanity, or in the ancient interests of the Rebellion.
I am anxious that this judiciary should be pure
and devoted to Human Rights. But if the policy is
pursued which finds such strenuous support, especially
from the Senator from Illinois, farewell then to such a
judiciary!&mdash;that judiciary which is often called the
Palladium of the Commonwealth, through which justice
is secured, rights protected, and all men are made
safe. Instead of that, you will have a judiciary true
only to those who have lately been in rebellion. You
will have a judiciary that will set its face like flint
against those loyalists that find so little favor with the
Senator from Illinois. You will have a judiciary that
will follow out the spirit which the Senator has shown
to-day, and do little else than pursue vindictively these
loyalists.</p>

<p>There has been allusion to the Governor of Virginia.
The Senator says I have made an assault upon him.
Oh, no! How have I assaulted him? I said simply
that I understood he was on the floor, as the member-elect
from Richmond was on the floor. That is all that
I said. But now there is something with regard to this
Governor to which I should like to have an answer:
possibly the Senator may be able to answer it. I have
here a speech purporting to have been made by him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
an agricultural fair in the southwest part of Virginia
after the election, from which, with your permission,
but, Sir, without adopting it at all or making myself in
any way responsible for its contents, I will read.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, addressing the audience, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A little talking sometimes does a great deal of good;
and that expended in the late canvass I heard in a voice of
thunder on the 6th of July, when the people of your noble
old Commonwealth declared themselves against vandalism,
fraud, and treachery. Virginia has freed herself from the
tyranny of a horde of greedy cormorants and unprincipled
carpet-baggers, who came to sap her very vitals. I have no
other feeling but that of pity for the opposition party, who
were deceived and led by adventurers having only their own
personal aggrandizement and aims in view, with neither interest,
character, nor self-respect at stake; for this a majority
of them never had.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sir, what are the operative words of this remarkable
speech? That this very Governor Walker,
who finds a vindicator&mdash;I may say, adopting a term of
the early law, a compurgator&mdash;in the Senator from Illinois,
announces that by this recent election Virginia has
“declared against vandalism, fraud, and treachery,&mdash;has
freed herself from the tyranny of a horde of greedy cormorants
and unprincipled carpet-baggers, who came to
sap her very vitals.”</p>

<p>Such is the language by which this Governor characterizes
loyal people from the North, from the West,
from all parts of the country, who since the overthrow
of the Rebellion have gone there with their household
gods, with their energies, with their character, with
their means, to contribute to the resources of the State!
Sir, what does all this suggest? To my mind unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
days in the future; to my mind anything but justice
for the devoted loyal people and Unionists of that
State. And now, Sir, while I make this plea for them,
again let me say I present no exclusive claim to represent
them; I speak now only because others do
not speak; and as in other days when I encountered
the opposition of the Senator from Illinois I was often
in a small minority, sometimes almost alone, I may
be so now; but I have a complete conviction that
the course I am now taking will be justified by the
future. Sad enough, if it be so! I hope it may be
otherwise.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Drake’s amendment was rejected. Another, thereupon offered
by Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, and as subsequently amended, requiring
members of the Legislature before taking or resuming their seats,
and State officers before entering upon office, to make oath to past loyalty
or removal of disabilities, was adopted. Other provisions, against
exclusion from civil rights on account of race or color, either by future
amendments of the existing State Constitution or by rescinding the
State’s ratification of any amendment to the National Constitution,
were moved as “fundamental conditions” of admission. In an argument,
January 14th, maintaining the validity of such conditions,
the pending question being on a provision of this character offered by
Mr. Drake, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;Something has been said of the
term by which this proposition should be designated.
One will not call it “compact,” finding in this term
much danger, but at the same time he refuses to the
unhappy people in Virginia now looking to us for protection
such safeguard as may be found in this proposition.
For myself, Sir, I make no question of terms.
Call it one thing or another, it is the same, for it has in
it protection. Call it a compact, I accept it. Call it a
law, I accept it. Call it a condition, I accept it. It i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>s
all three,&mdash;condition, law, compact,&mdash;and, as all three,
binding. The old law-books speak of a triple cord.
Here you have it.</p>

<p>My friend from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>] falls into
another mistake,&mdash;he will pardon me, if I suggest it,&mdash;which
I notice with regret. He exalts the technical
State above the real State. He knows well what is the
technical State, which is found in form, in technicality,
in privilege, if you please,&mdash;for he has made himself
to-night the advocate of privilege. To my mind the
State is the people, and its highest office is their just
safeguard; and when it is declared that a State hereafter
shall not take away the right of any of its people,
here is no infringement of anything that belongs to a
State. I entreat my friend to bear the distinction in
mind. A State can have no right or privilege to do
wrong; nor can the denial of this pretension disparage
the State, or in any way impair its complete equality
with other States. The States have no power except to
do justice. Any power beyond this is contrary to the
Harmonies of the Universe.</p>

<p>Since the Senator spoke, I sent into the other room
for the Declaration of Independence, in order to read
a sentence which is beyond question the touchstone
of our institutions, to which all the powers of a State
must be brought. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of
America in general Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme
Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions,
do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of
these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these United
Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
States.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>And then it proceeds to say that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract
alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts
and things which independent States may of right do.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the claim, with its limitation,&mdash;the great
claim, and its great limitation. The claim was Independence;
the limitation was Justice.</p>

<p>“Which independent States may of right do”: nothing
else, nothing which a State may not of right do.
Now, Sir, bear in mind, do not forget, that there is not
one thing prohibited by these fundamental conditions
that a State may of right do. Therefore, Sir, in the
name of Right, do I insist that it is binding upon the
State. It is binding, even if not there; and it is binding,
being there. Its insertion is like notice or proclamation
of the perpetual obligation.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask him
a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> In speaking of a State of this Union,
does not the Senator understand the term to apply to the
corporation, so to speak,&mdash;the Government of the State?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> I ask the Senator, then, in what way
the State of Virginia got out of the Union, except by destroying
the State Government which was a member of the
Union? Her territory was always in; her people were always
subject to the laws of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There I agree with the Senator. Her people
were always in; her territory was always in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> But her Government was not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Not out. Her Government was destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Yes, and thereby she ceased to be a
me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>mber of the Union.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Rather than say that she had ceased to be
a member of the Union, I would say that her Government
was destroyed. She never was able to take one foot of her
soil or one of her people beyond the jurisdiction of the Nation.
The people constitute the State in the just sense, and
it has been always our duty to protect them, and this I now
propose to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I return to the point, that what it is proposed to prohibit
by these fundamental conditions no State can of
right do. Therefore to require that Virginia shall not
do these things is no infringement of anything that belongs
to a State, for a State can have no such privilege.
My friend made himself, I said, the advocate of privilege.
He complained, that, if we imposed these conditions,
we should impair the “privileges” of a State.
No such thing. The State can have no such thing.
The Senator would not curtail a State of its fair proportions.
When will it be apparent that the license
to do wrong is only a barbarism?</p>

<p>Then, again, the Senator says, if this is already forbidden,
why repeat the prohibition in the form of a
new condition? Why, Sir, my friend is too well read
in the history of Liberty and of its struggles to make
that inquiry seriously. Does he not remember how in
English history Liberty has been won by just such repetitions?
It began with Magna Charta, followed shortly
afterward by a repetition; then again, in the time of
Charles the First, by another repetition; and then again,
at the Revolution of 1688, by still another repetition.
But did anybody at either of those great epochs say
that the repetition was needless, because all contained
in Magna Charta? True, it was all there; but the repetition
was needed in order to press it home upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
knowledge and the conscience of the people.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Will the Senator allow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carpenter.</span> Is not the great distinction in this fact,
that England has no written Constitution,&mdash;that the Great
Charter is a mere Act of Parliament, which may be repealed
to-morrow? With us we have a written Constitution; and
when its terms and provisions are once clear, do we not
weaken, do we not show our lack of faith, that is, our lack
of confidence in the value of the provisions, by reënacting it
in the form of a statute?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I must say I cannot follow my friend
to that conclusion, nor do I see the difference he makes
between Magna Charta in England and our Constitution.
I believe they are very much alike. And I believe
that the time is at hand when another document
of our history will stand side by side with the Constitution,
and enjoy with it coëqual authority, as it has more
than the renown of the Constitution: I mean the Declaration
of Independence. This is the first Constitution
of our history. It is our first Magna Charta. Nor can
any State depart from it; nor can this Nation depart
from it. To all the promises and the pledges of that
great Declaration are we all pledged, whether as Nation
or as State. The Nation, when it bends before them,
exalts itself; and when it requires their performance of
a State, again exalts itself, and exalts the State also.</p>

<p>So I see it. Full well, Sir, I know that in other
days, when Slavery prevailed in this Chamber, there
was a different rule of interpretation; but I had thought
that our war had changed all that. Sir, to my mind
the greatest victory in that terrible conflict was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> not at
Appomattox: oh, no, by no means! Nor was it in the
triumphal march of Sherman: oh, no, by no means!
This greatest victory was the establishment of a new
rule of interpretation by which the institutions of our
country are dedicated forevermore to Human Rights,
and the Declaration of Independence is made a living
letter instead of a promise. Clearly, unquestionably,
beyond all doubt, that, Sir, was the greatest victory
of our war,&mdash;greater than any found on any field of
blood: as a victory of ideas is above any victory of the
sword; as the establishment of Human Rights is the
end and consummation of government, without which
government is hard to bear, if not a sham.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 17th, the Joint Resolution as amended was laid on the table,
and the Senate took up the House bill, which admitted the State
to representation clear of all conditions; immediately whereupon Mr.
Edmunds moved the proviso concerning the oath to be taken by members
of the Legislature and State officers which had been attached to
the former measure.</p>

<p>The renewal of this proviso gave rise to renewed and protracted debate,
in the course of which, Mr. Sumner, in speeches on the 18th and
19th, in reply to an elaborate defence of Governor Walker by Mr.
Stewart against the charges of disloyalty and meditated bad faith, adduced
copious extracts from speeches of the Governor and others, together
with numerous letters from various parts of the State, all serving
to show, as he conceived, that the late election was “one huge,
colossal fraud.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Sumner’s colleague, Mr. Wilson, with a view to “a
bill in which all could unite,” moved the reference of the pending bill
to the Committee on the Judiciary, “for the purpose of having the
whole question thoroughly examined,”&mdash;a motion which on the part
of the Committee itself was strenuously opposed.</p>

<p>Upon this posture of the case, January 19th, Mr. Morton, of Indiana,
remarked, that “there seemed to be an obstinate determination
that Virginia must come in according to the bill reported by the Committee
or not come in at all,”&mdash;that “the Senator from Nevada [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Stewart</span>], with all h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>is zeal and his good intentions, was standing as
substantially in the way of the admission of Virginia as the Senator
from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>]”; and turning to the latter, he said:
“It seems that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is unwilling
that Virginia shall come in now upon any terms; and the Senator
has developed more clearly this morning than he has done before
what his desire is. It is that there shall be a new election in Virginia.
Am I right in regard to that?”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I have not said that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Then what does the Senator’s argument mean, that the
last election was a monstrous fraud? What is the object in proving that
the last election was a monstrous fraud, unless the Senator wants a new
election? Let us have an understanding about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I wish to purge the Legislature of its Rebels. I understand
that three-fourths of the Legislature, if not more, cannot take the
test oath. That is what I first propose to do.</p>

</div>

<p>After further remarks by Mr. Morton, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;In what the Senator from Indiana
has said in reply to the Senator from Nevada I entirely
sympathize. I unite with the Senator from Indiana in
his amendments. I unite with him in his aspirations
for that security in the future which I say is the first
great object now of our legislation in matters of Reconstruction.
Without security in the future Reconstruction
is a failure; and that now should be our first, prime
object. But while I unite with the Senator on those
points, he will pardon me, if I suggest to him that he
has not done me justice in his reference to what I said.
And now, Sir, before I comment on his remarks, I ask
to have the pending motion read.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">The Presiding Officer.</span> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, of Rhode Island,
in the chair.) The pending motion is the motion of
the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>] to refer the
bill to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> So I understood, Sir, and it was to
that motion that I spoke. I argued that the bill and
all pending questions should be referred to the Committee,&mdash;and
on what ground? That the election was
carried by a colossal fraud. The Senator complains because
I did not go further, and say whether I would
have a new election or not. The occasion did not require
it. I am not in the habit, the Senator knows
well, of hesitating in the expression of my opinions;
but logically the time had not come for the expression
of any opinion on that point. My argument was, that
there must be inquiry. To that point the Senate knows
well I have directed attention from the beginning of
this debate. I have said: “Why speed this matter?
Why hurry it to this rash consummation? Why, without
inquiry, hand over the loyalists of Virginia, bound
hand and foot, as victims?” That is what I have said;
and it is no answer for my friend to say that I do not
declare whether I would have a new election or not.</p>

<p>When an inquiry has been made, and we know officially
and in authentic form the precise facts, I shall be
ready to meet all the requirements of the occasion,&mdash;so,
at least, I trust. My friend, therefore, was premature
in his proposition to me. May I remind him of
that incident in the history of our profession, when a
very learned and eminent chief-justice of England said
to a counsellor at the bar, “Do not leap before you
come to the stile,”&mdash;in other words, Do not speak to
a point until the point has arisen?<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The point which
the Senator presents to me had not yet arisen; the question
was not before the Senate, whether there should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
a new election or not. There was no such motion; nor
did the occasion require its consideration. My aim was
in all simplicity to show the reasons for inquiry. Now
it may be, that, when that inquiry is made, it will appear
that I am mistaken,&mdash;that this election is not the
terrible fraud that I believe it,&mdash;that the loyal people,
black and white, will hereafter be secure in the State of
Virginia under the proposed Constitution. It may be
that all that will become apparent on the report of your
Committee. It is not apparent now. On the contrary,
just the opposite is apparent. It is apparent that loyalists
will not be secure, that freedmen will suffer unknown
peril, unless you now throw over them your protecting
arm.</p>

<p>That is my object. I wish to secure safety. I wish
to surround all my fellow-citizens in that State with an
impenetrable ægis. Is not that an honest desire? Is
it not a just aspiration? I know that my friend from
Indiana shares it with me; I claim no monopoly of
it, but I mention it in order to explain the argument
which I have made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the course of this debate there has been an iteration
of assertion on certain points. I mention two,&mdash;one
of fact, and the other of law. It has been said that
we are pledged to admit Virginia, and this assertion has
been repeated in every variety of form; and then it is
said that in point of law the test oath is not required.
Now to both these assertions, whether of fact or law, I
reply, “You are mistaken.” The pledge to admit Virginia
cannot be shown, and the requirement of the test
oath can be shown.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>It is strange to see the forgetfulness of great principles
into which Senators have been led by partisanship.
Certain Senators forget the people, forget the lowly,
only to remember Rebels. They forget that our constant
duty is to protect our fellow-citizens in Virginia
at all hazards. This is our first duty, which cannot be
postponed. In the reconstruction of Virginia it must
be an ever-present touchstone.</p>

<p>Look at the text of the Reconstruction Acts, or their
spirit, and it is the same. By their text the first and
commanding duty is, “that peace and good order should
be enforced in said States <i>until loyal and republican
State governments can be legally established</i>”; and until
then “any civil governments which may exist therein
shall be deemed <i>provisional</i> only, and in all respects
subject to the paramount authority of the United States
at any time to abolish, modify, control, or supersede the
same.” Such are the duties and powers devolved upon
Congress by the very terms of the first Reconstruction
Act.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The duty is to see that “loyal and republican
State governments” be established; and the power is
“to abolish, modify, control, or supersede” the provisional
governments.</p>

<p>It is not enough to say that Virginia has performed
certain things required by the statute. This is not
enough. The Senate must be satisfied that her government
is loyal and republican. This opens the question
of fact. Is Virginia loyal? Is her Legislature
loyal? Is the new Government loyal? These questions
must be answered. How is the fact? Do not
tell me that Virginia has complied with c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>ertain formal
requirements. Behind all these is the great requirement
of Loyalty. Let Senators who insist upon her
present swift admission show this loyalty. There is no
plighted faith of Congress which can supersede this
duty. Disloyalty is like fraud; it vitiates the whole
proceeding. Such is the plain meaning of the text in
its words.</p>

<p>But if we look at the spirit of the Acts, the conclusion
becomes still more irresistible. It is contrary to
reason and to common sense to suppose that Congress
intended to blind its eyes and tie its hands, so that it
could see nothing and do nothing, although the State
continued disloyal to the core. And yet this is the
argument of Senators who set up the pretension of
plighted faith. There is Virginia with a Constitution
dabbled in blood, with a Legislature smoking with Rebellion,
and with a Governor commending himself to
Rebels throughout a long canvass by promising to strike
at common schools; and here is Congress blindfold and
with hands tied behind the back. Such is the picture.
To look at it is enough.</p>

<p>Sir, the case is clear,&mdash;too clear for argument. Congress
is not blindfold, nor are its hands tied. Congress
must see, and it must act. But the loyalty of a State
should be like the sun in the heavens, so that all can
see it. At present we see nothing but disloyalty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next assertion concerns the test oath; and on
this point I desire to be precise.</p>

<p>General Canby, the military commander in Virginia,
thought that the test oath, or “iron-clad,” should be required
in the organization of the Virginia Legislature.
This opinion was given after careful examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> of the
statutes, and was reaffirmed by him at different times.
According to him, the test oath must be applied until
the Constitution has been approved by Congress; and
in one of his letters the commander says, “Its application
to the seceded States before they were represented
in Congress appears to be the natural result of their
political relation to the Union, independent of the requirements
of the ninth section of the law of July 19,
1867.”<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> To my mind this opinion is unanswerable,
and it is reinforced by the reason assigned. Nothing
could be more natural than that the test oath, which
was expressly required of the Boards of Registration
and of other functionaries, should be required of the
Legislature, so long as the same was within the power
of Congress. The reason for it in one case was equally
applicable in the other case; nay, it was stronger, if
possible, in the case of the Legislature, inasmuch as
the powers of the latter are the most vital. It is this
Legislature which is to begin the new State government.
Two essential parts of the system depend upon
it,&mdash;the courts of justice, which are to be reorganized,
and the common schools. To my mind it is contrary
to reason that the establishment and control of these
two great agencies should be committed to a disloyal
Legislature,&mdash;in other words, to a Legislature that cannot
take the test oath. The requirement of this oath
is only a natural and reasonable precaution, without
harshness or proscription. It is simply for the sake of
security. Therefore is General Canby clearly right on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
grounds of reason.</p>

<p>Looking at the text of the Reconstruction Acts, the
conclusion of reason is confirmed by a positive requirement.
By the ninth section of the Act of July 19,
1867,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> it is provided,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all members of said Boards of Registration, and all
persons hereafter elected or appointed to office in said military
districts, <i>under any so-called State or municipal authority</i>,
… shall be required to take and to subscribe the oath
of office prescribed by law for officers of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>Senators find ambiguity in the terms “under any <i>so-called
State</i> or municipal authority”; but I submit, Sir,
that this is because they do not sufficiently regard the
whole series of Reconstruction Acts and construe these
words in their light. If there be any ambiguity, it is
removed by other words, which furnish a precise and
unassailable definition of the term “so-called State authority.”
By the Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867,
it is provided, “that, until the people of said Rebel
States shall be by law admitted to representation in the
Congress of the United States, any civil governments
which may exist therein shall be deemed <i>provisional
only</i>, and in all respects subject to the paramount authority
of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> This is clear and precise.
Until the people are admitted to representation,
the State government is “provisional only,”&mdash;or, in
other words, it is a “so-called State authority.” Now
the Legislature was elected under “so-called State authority,”&mdash;that
is, under a State constitution which
was “provisional only.” Therefore, according to the
very text of the Reconstruction Acts, one interpret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ing
another, must this test oath be required.</p>

<p>If it be insisted that the Legislature was not elected
under “so-called State authority,” pray under what authority
was it elected? Perhaps it will be said, of the
United States. Then surely it would fall under the
general requirement of the Act of July 2, 1862,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> prescribing
the test oath to all officers of the United States.
But I insist upon this application of the statute only in
reply to those who would exclude the Legislature from
the requirement of the Reconstruction Act. I cannot
doubt that it comes precisely and specifically within
this requirement.</p>

<p>This conclusion is enforced by three additional arguments.</p>

<p>1. By a resolution of Congress bearing date February
6, 1869, “respecting the provisional governments of
Virginia and Texas,”<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> it is declared “that the persons
now holding civil offices in the provisional governments
of Virginia and Texas, who cannot take and subscribe
the oath prescribed by the Act entitled ‘An Act to prescribe
an Oath of Office, and for other Purposes,’ approved
July 2, 1862, shall, on the passage of this Resolution,
be removed therefrom.” By these plain words
is the purpose of Congress manifest. The test oath is
prescribed for all persons “holding civil offices in the
provisional government of Virginia.” But, by requirement
in the first Reconstruction Act, the provisional
government lasts until the State is admitted to representation.</p>

<p>2. Then comes a well-known rule of interpretation,
requiring that words shall be construed <i>ut res <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>magis valeat
quam pereat</i>,&mdash;in other words, so that the object
shall prevail rather than perish. But the very object
of the Reconstruction Act on which this question arises
was to keep Rebels from the State government. This
object is apparent from beginning to end. But this
object is defeated by any interpretation disallowing the
test oath.</p>

<p>3. Then comes another rule of interpretation, which
is of equal obligation. It is, that we are always to incline
so as to protect Liberty and Right; and this rule,
for double assurance, is embodied in the very text of
the statute whose meaning is now under consideration,
being the last section, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all the provisions of this Act, and of the Acts to
which this is supplementary, shall be construed liberally, to
the end that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly
carried out.”<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Following this rule, we find still another reason for
so interpreting the statute as to require the test oath.</p>

<p>Thus by the reason of the case, by the natural signification
of the text, by the light furnished from the supplementary
statute, by the rule of interpretation that
the object must prevail rather than perish, and by that
other commanding rule which requires a liberal interpretation
favorable to Liberty and Human Rights,&mdash;by
all these considerations, any one of which alone is
enough, while the whole make a combination of irresistible,
infinite force, are we bound to require the test
oath.</p>

<p>There is one remark of Andrew Johnson, just, wise,
and patriotic, for which I can forget many derelic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>tions
of duty, when he said, “For the Rebels back seats.” I
borrow this language. The time will come when Rebels
will be welcome to the full copartnership of government;
but this can be only when all are secure in their
rights. Until then, “for the Rebels back seats.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 21st, the long debate terminated with an arraignment by
Mr. Trumbull of Mr. Sumner’s course in reference not only to the
pending bill, but to former measures of Reconstruction, and an answer
of similar scope by Mr. Sumner, concluding with regard to Virginia<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The next count in the Senator’s indictment was, that
I had called the late election in Virginia a fraud; and
how did he encounter this truthful allegation? He proceeded
to show that General Canby designated only five
counties in which there were cases of fraud. Is that an
answer to my entirely different allegation? Does the
Senator misunderstand me, or is it an unintentional
change of issue? My statement was entirely different
from that which he attributes to me. I made no allegation
of frauds in different counties, be they few or
many.</p>

<p>I said that the election in the whole State was carried
by a conspiracy reaching from one end of the State
to the other, of which the candidate for Governor was
the head, to obtain the control of the State, and by this
means take the loyalists away from the protecting arms
of Congress. That was my allegation. Is that met by
saying to me that I do not adduce evidence of fraud in
districts, or that there were only five districts with regard
to which we have such evidence? How do I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
know, that, if you should go into an inquiry, you might
not find that very evidence with regard to all the districts?
The Senator sets his face against inquiry, as we
all know. But I did not intend to open this question.
My object was entirely different: it was to show that
from beginning to end the whole canvass was a gigantic
fraud; that Walker by a fraudulent conspiracy imposed
himself upon the State; that by appeals to the
Rebels he obtained their votes and thus installed himself
in power, with the understanding that when once
installed he should administer the State in their interest.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, farewell the equal rights of all! farewell an
equal judiciary, which is the Palladium of just government!
farewell trial by jury! farewell suffrage for all!
farewell that system of public schools which is essential
to the welfare of the community!&mdash;all sacrificed to this
conspiracy. Such, Sir, is my allegation; and it was in
making this allegation I challenged reply. I challenge
it now. When I first made it, I looked about the Senate,
I looked at those who are most strenuous for this
sacrifice, and none answered. None can answer. The
evidence is before the Senate in the speeches of the
Governor and in the election.</p>

<p>Sir, shall I follow the Senator in other things? I
hesitate. I began by saying I would not follow him in
his personalities. I began by saying that I would meet
the counts of his indictment, one by one, precisely on
the facts. Have I not done so, turning neither to the
right nor to the left? I have no taste for controversy;
much rather would I give the little of strength that
now remains for me to the direct advocacy of those
great principles to which my life in humble measur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>e
has been dedicated, not forgetting any of my other duties
as a Senator. If I have in any respect failed, I regret
it. Let me say in all simplicity, I have done much
less than I wish I had. I have failed often,&mdash;oh, how
often!&mdash;when I wish I had prevailed. No one can regret
it more than I. But I have been constant and
earnest always. Such, God willing, such I mean to be
to the end.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, as I stand before the Senate, trying by
a last effort to prevent the sacrifice of Unionists, white
and black, in Virginia, I feel that I am discharging only
a simple duty. To do less would be wretched failure.
I must persevere. This cause I have at heart; this people
I long to save; this great State of Virginia I long
to secure as a true and loyal State in the National Union.
Show that such is her character, and no welcome
shall surpass mine.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wilson’s motion for a reference of the bill having been withdrawn,
the Senate proceeded to vote on the various amendments offered.
Mr. Edmunds’s Proviso was carried by Yeas 45, Nays 16.
Other amendments, imposing “fundamental conditions,” to secure
equality in suffrage, in eligibility to office, and in school rights and
privileges, passed by small majorities. A Preamble, moved by Mr.
Morton, declaring “good faith” in the framing and adoption of a republican
State Constitution and in the ratification of the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments to the National Constitution “a condition
precedent to representation of the State in Congress,” was adopted by
Yeas 39, Nays 20. The bill as thus amended then passed by Yeas 47,
Nays 10. Mr. Sumner voted for all the amendments, but did not vote
upon the bill itself,&mdash;it being his opinion, as shown by his speeches
during the debates, that the admission of Virginia at that time, with
its legislative and executive departments as then constituted, would
endanger the rights and security of her loyal people.</p>

<p class="center">A Bill to authorize the refunding and consolidation of the national debt,
to extend banking facilities, and to establish specie payments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
in Congress assembled</i>, That, for the purpose of refunding the debt of the
United States and reducing the interest thereon, the Secretary of the
Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized to issue, on the credit of the
United States, coupon or registered bonds, of such denominations not less
than fifty dollars as he may think proper, to an amount not exceeding
$500,000,000, redeemable in coin, at the pleasure of the Government, at
any time after ten years, and payable in coin at forty years from date, and
bearing interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum, payable semiannually
in coin; and the bonds thus authorized may be disposed of at the discretion
of the Secretary, under such regulations as he shall prescribe, either
in the United States or elsewhere, at not less than their par value, for coin;
or they may be exchanged for any of the outstanding bonds, of an equal aggregate
par value, heretofore issued under the Act of February 25, 1862, and
known as the Five-Twenty bonds of 1862, and for no other purpose; and
the proceeds of so much thereof as may be disposed of for coin shall be
placed in the Treasury, to be used for the redemption of such six per cent.
bonds at par as may not be offered in exchange, or to replace such amount
of coin as may have been used for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be, and he is hereby, authorized to issue, on the credit of the United States,

rate of interest; and the proceeds of such bonds as may be sold for coin
shall be deposited in the Treasury, to be used for the redemption of such
obligations as by the terms of issue may be or may become redeemable or
payable, or to replace such coin as may have been used for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be, and he is hereby, authorized to issue, on the credit of the United
States, from time to time, coupon or registered bonds, of such denominations
not less than fifty dollars as he may think proper, to the amount of
$500,000,000, redeemable in coin, at the pleasure of the Government, at
any time after twenty years, and payable in coin at sixty years from date,

the Secretary, either in the United States or elsewhere, at not less than
their par value, for coin, or for United States notes, national-bank notes, or
fractional currency; or may be exchanged for any of the obligations of the
United States, of whatever character, that may be outstanding at the date
of the issue of such bonds. And if in the opinion of the Secretary of the
Treasury it is thought advisable to issue a larger amount of four per cent.
bonds for any of the purposes herein or hereinafter recited than would be
otherwise authorized by this section of this Act, such further issues are
hereby authorized: <i>Provided</i>, That there shall be no increase in the aggregate
debt of the United States in consequence of any issues authorized by
this Act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the bonds authorized by this
Act shall be exempt from all taxation by or under national, State, or municipal
authority. Nor shall there be any tax upon, or abatement from, the
interest or income thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the present limit of $300,000,000
as the aggregate amount of issues of circulating notes by national banks be,
and the same is hereby, extended, so that the aggregate amount issued and
to be issued may amount to, but shall not exceed, $500,000,000; and the
additional issue hereby authorized shall be so distributed, if demanded, as
to give to each State and Territory its just proportion of the whole amount

of law authorizing national banks, in so far as such provisions are not modified
by this Act: <i>Provided</i>, That for each dollar of additional currency
issued under the provisions of this Act there shall be withdrawn and cancelled

shall require the national banks, to whom may be awarded any part or portion
of the additional circulating notes authorized by the fifth section of
this Act, to deposit, before the delivery thereto of any such notes, with the
Treasurer of the United States, as security for such circulation, registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
bonds of the description authorized by the third section of this Act, in the
proportion of not less than one hundred dollars of bonds for each and every
eighty dollars of notes to be delivered; and the Secretary of the Treasury
shall require from existing national banks, in substitution of the bonds already
deposited with the Treasurer of the United States as security for
their circulating notes, a deposit of registered bonds authorized by the
third section of this Act to an amount not less than one hundred dollars
of bonds for every eighty dollars of notes that have been or may hereafter
be delivered to such banks, exclusive of such amounts as have been cancelled.
And if any national bank shall not furnish to the Treasurer of the
United States the new bonds, as required by this Act, within three months
after having been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury of his readiness
to deliver such bonds, it shall be the duty of the Treasurer, so long as such
delinquency exists, to retain from the interest, as it may become due and
payable, on the bonds belonging to such delinquent banks on deposit with
him as security for circulating notes, so much of such interest as shall be
in excess of four per cent. per annum on the amount of such bonds, which
excess shall be placed to the credit of the sinking fund of the United States;
and all claims thereto on the part of such delinquent banks shall cease and
determine from that date; and the percentage of currency delivered or to
be delivered to any bank shall in no case exceed eighty per cent. of the face
value of the bonds deposited with the Treasurer as security therefor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, whenever the premium on gold
shall fall to or within five per cent., it shall be the duty of the Secretary of
the Treasury to give public notice that the outstanding United States notes,
or other legal-tender issues of the Government, will thereafter be received
at par for customs duties; and the interest on the issues known as three
per cent. legal-tender certificates shall cease from and after the date of such
notice; and all such legal-tender obligations, when so received, shall not
again be uttered, but shall forthwith be cancelled and destroyed. And so
much of the Act of February 25, 1862, and of all subsequent Acts, as creates
or declares any of the issues of the United States, other than coin, a
legal tender, be, and the same is hereby, repealed; such repeal to take effect
on and after the first day of January, 1871.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I have already during this session
introduced a bill providing for the extension
of the national banking system and the withdrawal of
greenbacks in proportion to the new bank-notes issued,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
thus preparing the way for specie payments. The more
I reflect upon this simple proposition, the more I am
satisfied of its value. It promises to be as efficacious as
it is unquestionably simple. But it does not pretend to
deal with the whole financial problem.</p>

<p>The bill which I now introduce is more comprehensive
in character. While embodying the original proposition
of substituting bank-notes for greenbacks, it provides
for the refunding and consolidation of the national
debt in such a way as to make it easy to bear, while it
brings the existing currency to a par with coin. In
making this attempt I am moved by the desire to do
something for the business interests of the country,
which suffer inconceivably from the derangement of
the currency. Whether at home or abroad, it is the
same. At home values are uncertain; abroad commerce
is disturbed and out of gear. Political Reconstruction
is not enough; there must be Financial Reconstruction
also. The peace which we covet must enter into our
finances; the reconciliation which we long for must embrace
the disordered business of the country.</p>

<p>In any measure having this object there are two
things which must not be forgotten: first, the preservation
of the national credit; and, secondly, the reduction
of existing taxation. Happily, there is a universal
prevailing sentiment for the national credit, showing itself
in a fixed determination that it shall be maintained
at all hazards. Nobody can exaggerate the value of t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>his
determination, which is the corner-stone of Financial
Reconstruction. On the reduction of taxation there is
at present more difference of opinion; but I cannot
doubt that here, too, there will be a speedy harmony.
The country is uneasy under the heavy burden. Willingly,
gladly, patriotically, it submitted to this burden
while the Republic was in peril; but now there is a
yearning for relief. War taxes should not be peace
taxes; and so long as the present system continues,
there is a constant and painful memento of war, while
business halts in chains and life bends under the load.</p>

<p>The national credit being safe, relief from the pressure
of existing taxation is the first practical object in
our finances. But so entirely natural and consistent is
this object, that it harmonizes with all other proper objects,
especially with the refunding of the national debt,
and with specie payments. As the people feel easy in
their affairs, they will be ready for the work of Reconstruction.
Therefore do I say, as an essential stage in
what we all desire, <i>Down with the taxes!</i></p>

<p>The proper reduction of taxation involves two other
things: first, the reduction of the present annual interest
on the national debt, thus affording immense relief;
and, secondly, the spread or extension of the national
debt over succeeding generations, for whom, as well as
for ourselves, it was incurred. The practical value of
the first is apparent on the simple statement. The
second may be less apparent, as it opens a question of
policy, on both sides of which much has been already
said.</p>

<p>Nobody doubts the brilliancy of the movement to pay
off the national debt,&mdash;calling to mind the charge of the
six hundred at Balaclava riding into the jaws of Death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
so that the beholder exclaimed, in memorable words,
“It is magnificent, but it is not war.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In other words,
it was a feat of hardihood and immolation, abnormal,
eccentric, and beyond even the terrible requirements of
battle. In similar spirit might a beholder, witnessing
the present sacrifice of our people in the redemption of
a debt so large a part of which justly belongs to posterity,
exclaim, “It is magnificent, but it is not business.”
Unquestionably business requires that we should meet
existing obligations according to their letter and spirit;
but it does not require payment in advance, nor payment
of obligations resting upon others. To do this is
magnificent, but beyond the line of business.</p>

<p>President Lincoln, in one of his earliest propositions of
Emancipation, before he had determined upon the great
Proclamation, contemplated compensation to slave-masters,
and, in order to commend this large expenditure,
went into an elaborate calculation to show how easy it
would be, if proportioned upon the giant shoulders of
posterity. Dismissing the idea of payment by the existing
generation, he proceeded to exhibit the growing
capacity of the country,&mdash;how from the beginning there
had been a decennial increase in population of 34.60
per cent.,&mdash;how during a period of seventy years the
ratio had never been two per cent. below or two per
cent. above this average, thus attesting the inflexibility
of this law of increase. Assuming its continuance, he
proceeded to show that in 1870 our population would
be 42,323,341,&mdash;in 1880 it would be 56,967,216,&mdash;in
1890 it would be 76,677,872,&mdash;and in 1900 it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
be 103,208,415,&mdash;while in 1930 it would amount to
251,680,914.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Nobody has impeached these estimates.
There they stand in that Presidential Message as colossal
mile-stones of the Republic.</p>

<p>The increase in material resources is beyond that of
population. The most recent calculation, founded on
the last census, shows that for the previous decade it
was at the rate of eighty per cent.,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> although other calculations
have placed it as high as one hundred and
twenty-six per cent.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Whether the one or the other,
the rate of increase is enormous, and, unless arrested in
some way not now foreseen, it must carry our national
resources to a fabulous extent. What is a burden
now will be scarcely a feather’s weight in the early decades
of the next century, when a population counted
by hundreds of millions will wield resources counted
by thousands of millions. On this head details are superfluous.
All must see at once the irresistible conclusion.</p>

<p>It is much in this discussion, when we have ascertained
how easy it will be for posterity to bear this responsibility.
But the case is strengthened, when it is
considered that the war was for the life of the Republic,
so that throughout all time, so long as the Republic
endures, all who enjoy its transcendent citizenship
will share the benefits. Should they not contribute to
the unparalleled cost? Recent estimates, deemed to be
moderate and reasonable, show an aggregate destruction
of wealth or diversion of wealth-producing industry in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the United States since 1861 approximating nine thousand
millions of dollars, being the cost of the war, or, in
other words, the cost of the destruction of Slavery.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> If
from this estimate be dropped the item for expenditures
and loss of property in the Rebel States, amounting to
$2,700,000,000,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> we shall have $6,300,000,000 as the
sum-total of cost to the loyal people, of which the existing
national debt represents less than half. Thus,
besides precious blood beyond any calculation of arithmetic,
the present generation has already contributed
immensely to that result in which succeeding generations
have a stake even greater than theirs.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that there is to be no considerable
taxation for the immediate payment of the debt, we
have one economy. If to this be added another economy
from the reduction of the interest, we shall be able
to relieve materially all the business interests of the
country. Two such economies will be of infinite value
to the people, whose riches will be proportionally increased.
In the development of wealth, next to making
money is saving money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bearing these things in mind, Financial Reconstruction
is relieved of its difficulties. It only remains to
find the proper machinery or process. And here we encounter
the propositions of the Secretary of the Treasury
in his Annual Report,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which are threefold:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To refund twelve hundred millions of six per cent.
Five-Twenty bonds in four and a half per cent. Fiftee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>n-Twenties,
Twenty-Twenty-Fives, and Twenty-Five-Thirties.</p>

<p>2. To make our exports equal in value with our imports,
and to restore our commercial marine.</p>

<p>3. To regard these as essential conditions of reduced
taxation and specie payments.</p>

<p>Considering these propositions with the best attention
I could give to them, I have been impressed by
their inadequacy as a system at the present moment.
I cannot easily consent to the postponement which they
imply. They hand over to the future what I wish to
see accomplished at once, and what I cannot doubt with
a firm will can be accomplished at an early day. But
besides this capital defect, apparent on the face, I find
in the system proposed no assurance of success. Will
it work? I doubt. Here I wish to be understood as
expressing myself with proper caution; and I wish further
to declare my anxiety to obtain the substituted
loans at the smallest rate of interest, and also my conviction
that within a short time, at some slight present
cost, this may be accomplished.</p>

<p>Looking at this question in the light of business, I
am driven to the conclusion that twelve hundred millions
of six per cents. cannot be refunded either now or
hereafter in four or four and a half per cents. without
offering compensation in an additional running period
of the bonds which is not found in the Fifteen-Twenties
nor in the Twenty-Five-Thirties proposed by the
Secretary. With such bonds there would be a practical
difficulty in the way of any such refunding to any considerable
amount, from the inability to command a sufficient
amount of coin under the “option of coin,” which
must accompany the offer; nor is there any fund <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>applicable
to the purchase of coin in open market, were such
a course desirable. Obviously, to induce the voluntary
relinquishment of bonds at a high rate of interest for
other bonds at a less rate, the holders must be offered
something preferable to the coin tendered as an alternative.</p>

<p>The time has passed when holders can be menaced
with payment in greenbacks. Whatever we do must be
in coin, or in some bond which will be taken rather
than coin. The attempt at too low a rate of interest
would cause the coin to be taken rather than the bond,
if we had the article at command,&mdash;and would end in
a deluge of coin, sweeping away the premium on gold.
A return to specie payments, thus precipitated, would
be of doubtful value, if not illusive, without other and
sustaining measures.</p>

<p>In the suggestion that our exports must be augmented,
and our commercial marine restored, I sympathize
cordially; but I do not see how this can be accomplished
so long as the present taxation is maintained,
exercising such a depressing influence on all industry,
making the necessaries of life dearer, adding to the cost
of raw material, and generally enhancing the price of
our products so as to prevent them from competing in
foreign markets with the products of other nations.</p>

<p>The proposition to make the interest on the new
bonds payable at various points in Europe, at the option
of the holder, seems unnecessary, while it is open
to objections. Such agencies would be onerous and
cumbersome. At London, Paris, Frankfort, and Berlin,
there must be a machinery, with constant complications,
continuing through the lifetime of the bonds, to
secure the transfers from point to point and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> obligatory
remittances in gold; nor am I sure that in this
way foreign powers might not obtain a certain jurisdiction
over our monetary transactions. But I confess
that the ruling objection with me is of a different character.
New York is our commercial centre, designated
by Providence and confirmed by man. Already it has
made a great advance, but it is not yet quoted abroad as
one of the clearing points of the world. At New York
quotations are obtained daily on London and Paris; but
in these places no such recognized quotations can be
now obtained on New York. That the agencies proposed
will tend to postpone this condition is a sufficient
objection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have made these remarks with hesitation, but in
order to prepare the way for the bill which I have introduced.
It was my duty to show why the propositions
of the Secretary were not sufficient for the occasion,
and this I have tried to do simply and frankly. It
is long since I avowed my conviction that specie payments
should be resumed; and I should now do less
than my duty, if I did not at least attempt to show
the way which seems to me so natural and easy. While
the present system continues, we are poor. The payment
of the national debt and the accumulation of coin
in the Treasury are the signs of unparalleled national
wealth, but our financial condition is not in harmony
with these signs. The latest figures from the Treasury
are such as no other nation can exhibit. From these it
appears that the amount of bonds purchased since March
1, 1869, for the sinking fund was $22,000,000, and the
amount purchased subject to Congress $64,000,000, being
in all $86,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The same proportion of purchas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>e
for January and February would be $23,000,000,
making a sum-total of $109,000,000 for one year. And
notwithstanding this outlay, we find in the Treasury,
January 1, 1870, in coin no less than $109,159,000,
and in currency $12,773,000, making a sum-total of
$121,932,000. And yet, with these tokens of national
resources manifest to the world, our bonds are below
par, and our currency is inconvertible paper. This
should not be permitted longer. With all these resources
there must be a way, even if we were not taught
that a will always finds a way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The refunding of an existing loan implies two distinct
and independent transactions: first, the extinction,
by payment in some form, of the existing loan; and,
secondly, the negotiation of a new loan to an amount
equal to that extinguished.</p>

<p>The bill now before the Senate contemplates the
prompt extinguishment of the Five-Twenties of 1862.
But I would not have this important work entered upon
until the Government is fully prepared to say, that, after
a certain period of notice, say six months, in order
that distant holders in Europe may be advised, interest
on the Five-Twenties of 1862 shall cease, and the bonds
be forthwith redeemed in coin. There should be no coercion
of any kind upon any holder, at home or abroad,
to induce the acceptance of a substitute bond. I am
happy to believe, that, with the judicious use of five per
cent. Ten-Forties, all the coin necessary for such indepen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>dent
action may be assured in advance. Believing
that such five per cent. bonds will be regarded by investors
as preferable to coin, I would give the holders of
the old bonds the first opportunity to subscribe for the
new. Those who elect coin will make room for others
ready to give coin in exchange for such bonds.</p>

<p>If we look at the practical consequences, we shall
be encouraged in this course. The refunding of the
sixes of 1862, being upward of five hundred millions,
in fives, as authorized by the first section of the bill,
contemplates the payment from present funds of little
more than fourteen millions, being the excess of Five-Twenties
above the five hundred millions provided for.
The annual reduction of interest on that loan will be
$5,886,296. The substitution of three hundred millions
of fours for a like amount of sixes, as provided
in the bill, will operate a further saving of $6,000,000,
making a sum-total of $11,886,296, or near twelve millions.
There will then remain but $129,443,800, subject
to redemption, being Five-Twenties of 1864.</p>

<p>During the year 1870 the further sum of $536,326,200,
being Five-Twenties of 1865, will fall within the control
of the Government, when, as it seems to me, and
according to the contemplation of the bill, the credit of
the Government will be at such a pitch that five hundred
millions can be refunded in four and a half per
cents., with the addition of thirty-six millions paid from
the Treasury,&mdash;thus insuring a further annual reduction
of $9,679,572, or a total annual saving of $21,565,868,
of which about twelve millions may be saved during the
current year.</p>

<p>Here for the present we stop. Our interest-paying
debt cannot be further ameliorated before 1872, w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>hen
three hundred and seventy-nine millions, being Five-Twenties
of 1867, will become redeemable, and then
in 1873, when forty-two millions, being Five-Twenties
of 1868, and constituting the balance of our optional
sixes, will become redeemable,&mdash;all of which I gladly
believe may be refunded in the four per cents. provided
by the present bill, to be followed in 1874 by a reduction
of the original Ten-Forties into similar bonds.</p>

<p>I would remark here that the bill undertakes to deal
with the whole disposable national debt. The amounts
which I have given will be found in the Treasury tables
of January 1st, and are irrespective of the sinking fund
and invested surplus.</p>

<p>From these details I pass to consider the bill in its
aims and principles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The proposition with which I begin is to refund our
six per cent. Five-Twenties of 1862, amounting to upward
of five hundred millions, in five per cent. Ten-Forties.
In taking the term “Ten-Forties,” I adopt the
description of a bond well known and popular at home
and abroad, whose payment “in coin” is expressly stipulated
by the original Act authorizing the issue.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The
bond begins with a good name, which will commend it.
The interest which I propose is larger than I would propose
for any late bond. It is important, if not necessary,
in order to counteract the suspicion which has
been allowed to fall upon our national credit. Even
our sixes are now below par in Europe. But they will
unquestionably share the elevation of the new fives substituted.
Our first attempt should be with the latter.
Let these be carried to par, and we shall ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ve par everywhere.</p>

<p>In this process the first stage is the conviction that
all our bonds will be paid in the universal money of the
world. All bonds, whether fives or sixes, will then advance.
I know no way in which this conviction can be
created so promptly and easily as by redeeming in gold
some one of our six per cent. loans; and that most naturally
selected is the first, which is already so noted
from the discussion to which it has been subjected. But
this can be done only by offering to holders the option
of coin or a satisfactory substitute bond. With a new
issue of five per cent. Ten-Forties, limited in amount to
about the aggregate of the six per cent. Five-Twenties
of 1862,&mdash;say five hundred millions,&mdash;I cannot doubt
that every foreign holder of such sixes will accept the
fives in lieu of coin; and so much of that loan as is held
at home may be paid in coin, if preferred by the holders,
from the proceeds of an equal amount of fives placed
in Europe at par for coin.</p>

<p>Then will follow the advantage of this positive policy.
The national credit will be beyond question. Nobody
will doubt it. The public faith will be vindicated.
The time will have come, which is the condition-precedent
named by the Secretary of the Treasury, when
“the want of faith in the Government” will be removed,
and the door will be open to cheap loans. This will be
of course: it cannot be otherwise, if we only do our
duty. Our fives, being limited in amount, after being
taken at par in preference to coin, will advance in value,
so that the investment will become popular. People
will desire more, but there will be no more; so that,
without difficulty or delay, we may hope to refund five
hundred millions of our subsequent sixes, or so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
may be desirable, at four and a half per cent. in Fifteen-Fifties,
if not at four per cent. in Twenty-Sixties.</p>

<p>In this operation the <i>initial point</i> is the national
credit. With this starting-point all is easy. Our fives
will at once ascend above par, while a market is opened
for four and a half or four per cents. The stigma of Repudiation,
whether breathed in doubt or hurled in taunt,
will be silenced. There are other fields of glory than in
war, and such a triumph will be among the most important
in the annals of finance. But to this end there
must be no hesitation. The offer must be plain,&mdash;“Bonds
or coin,”&mdash;giving the world assurance of our
determination. The answer will be as prompt as the
offer,&mdash;“Bonds, and not coin.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the process of Financial Reconstruction we cannot
forget the National Banks, which have already done
so much. The uniform currency which they supply
throughout the country commends them to our care.
Accustomed to the facilities this currency supplies, it
is difficult to understand how business was conducted
under the old system, when every bank had its separate
currency, taking its color, like the chameleon, from what
was about it, so that there were as many currencies, with
as many colors, as there were banks.</p>

<p>Two things must be done for the national banks:
first, the bonds deposited by them with the Government
must be reduced in interest; and, secondly, the
system must be extended, so as to supply much-needed
facilities, especially at the West and South.</p>

<p>I doubt if the national banks can expect to receive in
the future more than four per cent. from the bonds deposited
by them with the Government; and considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the profits attributed to their business, it may be that
there would be a reluctant consent even to this allowance.
Here it must be observed, that the whole system
of national banks is founded upon the bonds of the nation;
so that, at the rate of liquidation now adopted for
the national debt, the system will be without support in
the lapse of twelve or fifteen years. The stability of the
banks, which is so vital alike to the national currency
and to the pecuniary interests involved in the business,
can be assured only by an issue of bonds for a longer
term. Of course, the longer the period, the more valuable
the bond. To reduce the interest arbitrarily on the
existing short bonds of the banks, without offering compensation
in some form, would be positively unjust, besides
being an infringement of the guaranties surrounding
such bonds, and therefore a violation of good faith.
A substitute Twenty-Sixty bond will be assurance of
stability for this length of time, while the additional life
of the bond will be a compensation for the reduction of
interest. As it is not proposed to issue such bonds immediately,
except for banking purposes, they will not
fall below par, and this par will be coin, which, I need
not say, the sixes now held by the banks will not command.
If, through the failure or winding-up of any
bank, an amount of the substituted bonds should be
liberated, there will be an instant demand for them at
par by new banks arising to secure the relinquished circulation.</p>

<p>The extension of bank-notes from three to five hundred
millions, which I propose, will extend the banking
system where it is now needed. This alone is much.
How long the Senate debated this question at the last
session, without any practical result, cannot be forg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>otten.
That debate certifies to the necessity of this extension.
The proposition I offer shows how it may
be accomplished and made especially beneficent. The
requirement from all the banks of new four per cent.
bonds, at the rate of one hundred dollars for eighty
dollars of notes issued and to be issued, would absorb
six hundred and twenty-five millions of the national
debt into four per cents., while the withdrawal
of one dollar of greenbacks for each additional dollar
of notes will go far to extinguish the outstanding greenbacks,
thus quietly, and without any appreciable contraction,
removing an impediment to specie payments.
Naturally, as by a process of gestation, will this birth
be accomplished: it will come, and nobody can prevent
it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In presenting this series of measures, I am penetrated
by the conviction, that, if adopted, they cannot fail
to bring all the national obligations to a par with coin,
and then specie payments will be resumed without effort.
Our bonds will be among the most popular in the
market. No longer below par, they will continue to
advance, while the national credit lifts its head unimpeached,
unimpeachable. Under this influence the remainder
of our outstanding debt may be refunded in
Fifteen-Fifties at four and a half per cent., if not in
Twenty-Sixties at four per cent. There will then be
sixteen hundred and twenty-five millions refunded at
an average of less than four and a half per cent., and
the whole debt, including the irredeemable sixes of
1881, at an average of less than five per cent., while
all will be within our control five years earlier than in
the maximum period proposed by the Secretary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Treasury.</p>

<p>One immediate consequence of these measures would
be the relief of the people from eighty to one hundred
millions of taxation, while there would remain a surplus
revenue of two millions a month applicable to the reduction
of the debt, being more than enough to liquidate
the whole prior to the maturity of the new obligations,
if it were thought advisable to complete the
liquidation at so early a day. The country will breathe
freer, business will be more elastic, life will be easier,
as the assurance goes forth that no heavy taxation shall
be continued in order to pay the debt in eleven years,
as is now proposed, nor in fifteen years, nor in twenty
years. By the present measures, while retaining the
privilege of paying the debt within twenty years, we
shall secure the alternative of sixty years, and at a
largely reduced interest,&mdash;leaving the opportunity of
paying it at any intermediate time, according to the
best advantage of the country. With diminished taxation
and resources increasing immeasurably, the national
debt will cease to be a burden,&mdash;becoming “fine
by degrees and beautifully less” until it gradually ceases
to exist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In making this statement, I offer my contribution to
the settlement of a great question. If I am wrong, what
I have said will soon be forgotten. Meanwhile I ask
for it your candid attention, adding one further remark,
with which I shall close. I never have doubted, I cannot
doubt, the ease with which the transition to specie
payments may be accomplished, especially as compared
with the ominous fears which this simple proposition
seems to excite in certain quarters. We are gravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
warned against it as a period of crisis. I do not believe
there will be anything to which this term can be
reasonably applied. Like every measure of essential
justice, it will at once harmonize with the life of the
community, and people will be astonished at the long
postponement of an act so truly beneficent in all its influences,
so important to the national character, and so
congenial with the business interests of the country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The bill was ordered to be printed, and referred to the Committee on
Finance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 25th, a bill from the Committee on Finance, “to provide a
national currency of coin notes and to equalize the distribution of
circulating notes,” being under consideration, Mr. Sumner moved an
amendment embracing the provisions of his bill, with the exception of
the first, second, and seventh sections, as a substitute,&mdash;in support of
which he the next day spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;Some things seem to be admitted
in this debate as starting-points,&mdash;at least if I may
judge from the remarks of the Senator from Ohio [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Sherman</span>]. One of these is the unequal distribution of
the bank-note currency, and another is that to take
from the Northern and Eastern banks circulation already
awarded to them would disturb trade. I venture
to add, that the remedy would be worse than the
disease.</p>

<p>The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howe</span>] and the
Senator from Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>] justly claim for
the West and South a fair proportion of bank circulation.
The Senator from Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>] demands
more. While neither asks for expansion, neither
is ready for contraction. The last-named Senator
argues, that at this time the currency is not too much
for the area of country and the amount of business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
which, from the new spaces opened to settlement and
the increase of commerce, require facilities beyond those
that are adequate in thickly settled and wealthy communities.
His premises may be in the main sound;
but he might have made a further application of them.
If, in the absence of local banks and banking facilities,
a larger amount of circulation is needed,&mdash;and I do not
mean to question this assertion,&mdash;would it not follow
that the establishment of such local banks and banking
facilities, with new bank credits, checks of depositors,
and other agencies of exchange, and with the increase of
circulation, would more than counterbalance any slight
contraction from the withdrawal of greenbacks, and that
thus we should be tending toward specie payments?</p>

<p>The Senator from Kentucky said aptly, that, if we
wait until all are ready, we shall never resume. If the
Senator from Indiana is right in saying that prices have
already settled down in the expectation of an early resumption,
then to my mind the battle is half won and
we have only to proceed always in the right direction.</p>

<p>A simple redistribution of the existing currency cannot
be made without serious consequences to the business
of the country, while it will do nothing to correct
the evils of our present financial condition. It will
do nothing for Financial Reconstruction, nor will these
consequences be confined to any geographical section.
They will affect the South and West as well as the
North and East. I need only add that disturbance in
New York means disturbance everywhere in our country.</p>

<p>Nor is it easy to see how any redistribution can be
made, which, however just to-day, may not be unjust
to-morrow. As business develops and population exte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>nds
there will be new demand, with new inequalities
and new disturbances.</p>

<p>The original Banking Act<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> authorized a circulation of
$300,000,000, a large part of which went to the Northern
and Eastern States. All this was very natural; for
at that time there was no demand at the South, and
comparatively little at the West. With the supply of
capital at the East banks were promptly formed, even
before the State banks were permitted to come into the
new system. Subsequently the State banks were not
only permitted to come into the new system, but their
circulation was taxed out of existence. Here, then, was
banking capital idle. It was reasonable that the circulation
which was not demanded in other parts of the
country should be allotted to these banks. This I state
in simple justice to these banks. I might remind you
also of the patriotic service rendered by the banks of
New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, which in 1861
furnished the means by which our forces were organized
against the Rebellion. One hundred and fifty millions
in gold were furnished by these banks, of which
less than fifty millions were subsequently subscribed by
the people;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and this was at a moment when the national
securities had received a terrible shock. Not
from the South, not from the West, did financial succor
come at that time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In considering briefly the questions presented by the
pending measure I shall take them in their order. They
are two: first, to enlarge the national bank currency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and, secondly, to create a system of free banking founded
on coin notes. This leaves out of view the question
of refunding and consolidating the national debt; nor
does it touch the great question of specie payments.</p>

<p>I begin with the proposed enlargement of the currency.
The object is excellent, as is admitted by all;
but the practical question arises on the way it shall be
done.</p>

<p>If you look at the bill now before the Senate, you
will see that it authorizes an enlargement to the extent
of $45,000,000, and the withdrawal to that amount of
what are called three per cent. temporary loan certificates,
of which little more than this amount exists. The
extinction of this debt will accomplish an annual saving
of about $1,366,000. So far, so good. This amount of
$45,000,000 is allotted to banks organized in States and
Territories having less than their proportion under the
general Banking Act. This is right, and it removes to a
certain extent objections successfully urged at the last
session of Congress against a measure for the redistribution
of currency.</p>

<p>But, plainly and obviously, the measure of relief proposed
is not sufficient to meet the just demands of the
South and West; nor is it sufficient to prevent taking
from the North and East a portion of the currency now
enjoyed by them. Therefore in one part of the country
it will be inadequate, while in another it is unjust. Inadequacy
and injustice are bad recommendations.</p>

<p>When a complete remedy is in our power, why propose
a partial remedy? When a just remedy is in our
power, why propose an unjust remedy? There is another
question. I would ask also, Why unnecessarily
disturb existing and well-settled channels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> trade?&mdash;for
such must be the effect of a new apportionment, as
proposed, under the census of this year. Why not at
once provide another source from which to draw the
new supplies under the new apportionment? I open
this subject with these inquiries, which to my mind
answer themselves.</p>

<p>The proposition of the Committee is further embarrassed
by the provision for the cancellation each month
of the three per cent. certificates to an amount equal to
the aggregate of new notes issued during the previous
month. In order to judge the expediency of this
measure we must understand the origin and character
of these certificates.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury, desiring to avoid the
further issue of greenbacks, conceived the idea of a note
which could be used in the payment of Government obligations,
but in such form as not to enter into and inflate
the currency. This resulted in an interest-bearing
note payable three years after date, with six per cent.
interest compounded every six months and payable at
the maturity of the note in its redemption. This anomalous
note was made legal-tender for its face value only.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
It was not doubted that such notes, on the accumulation
of interest, would be withdrawn as an investment. Being
legal-tender, if they were allowed to be used by the
banks as part of their reserves, they would become, contrary
to the original purpose, part of the national circulation,
while the Government would be paying interest
on bank reserves, which no bank could demand. But
the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Secretary could not prevent their
use by the banks as part of the reserves. The intervention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of Congress was required, which, by the second
section of the Loan Act of June 30, 1864, provided as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nor shall any Treasury note bearing interest, issued under
this Act, be a legal tender in payment or redemption of
any notes issued by any bank, banking association, or banker,
calculated or intended to circulate as money.”<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this statement it seems clear that neither the
Secretary originating these compound-interest legal-tender
notes, nor the Act of Congress authorizing them, nor
the banks receiving them, contemplated their employment
as part of the bank reserves. How they reached
this condition remains to be told.</p>

<p>The whole issue of the compound-interest legal-tender
notes amounted to upward of two hundred and seventeen
millions.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> These were funded at or before maturity,
except some fifty millions, which as they matured
were exchanged for certificates to that amount bearing
three per cent. interest, and constituted part of the bank
reserves.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Here was an innovation as improvident as
new, being nothing less than bank reserves on interest.
This improvidence was increased by the manner of distribution,
which, instead of being ratable, seems to have
been according to the rule of “Who speaks first?” Of
course the banks within easy access of Washington had
peculiar opportunities, by which they were enabled to
secure these notes, and thus obtain interest on part of
their reserves, while banks at a distance, and especially
in the country, were not equal in opportunity. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
its partiality, this provision operates like a gratuity to
the banks having these notes.</p>

<p>Obviously these three per cent. certificates ought to
be withdrawn; but I do not like to see their withdrawal
conditioned on the extension of banking facilities.
Their case is peculiar, and they should be treated
accordingly. Nor should their accidental amount be
made the measure of banking facilities. They constitute
a part of the national debt, and should be considered
in the refunding and consolidation of this debt,
and not on a bill to provide banking facilities.</p>

<p>I think I do not err, if I conclude that the first part
of the pending measure is inadequate, while the cancellation
of the three per cent. certificates in the manner
proposed is inexpedient. All this is more observable
when it is considered that there is another way, ample
and natural.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the first part of the pending measure I pass to
the second part, being sections three, four, and five,
which, if I am not mistaken, authorize free banking,
with coin notes as a declared basis of coin. This is
plausible, but to my mind illusory and impracticable.
The machine will not work; but if it does work, its
first and most obvious operation will be to create a new
currency, adding a third to the greenbacks and bank-notes
already existing, besides creating a new class of
banks. Here I put the practical question, Can any
national bank issue and maintain a circulation of coin
notes with a reserve of only twenty-five per cent., so
long as gold commands a premium? How long would
the reserve last? It is easy to see that until specie
payments this idea is impracticable. It will not work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>.
In proportion to the premium on gold would be the run
on the banks, until their outstanding notes were redeemed
or their vaults emptied.</p>

<p>But the measure is not only impracticable,&mdash;it is
inexpedient, as multiplying, instead of simplifying, the
forms of currency. We have now two paper currencies,
distinct in form and with different attributes. Everybody
feels that this is unfortunate; and yet it is now
proposed to add another. Surely it is the dictate of
wisdom, instead of creating a third paper currency, to
disembarrass the country of one of those now existing
and make the other convertible into coin, so that we
may hereafter enjoy one uniform currency. I confess
my constant desire for measures to withdraw our greenbacks
and to make our present bank-notes coin notes.
Coin notes should be universal. Under any circumstances
the conclusion is irresistible, that the proposed plan,
if not utterly impracticable, is a too partial and timid
experiment, calculated to exercise very little influence
over the great question of specie payments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If I am right in this review, the bill of the Committee
does not deserve our support. But I do not confine
myself to criticism. I offer a substitute. Could I have
my way, I would treat the whole financial question as
a unit, providing at the same time for all the points involved
in what I have called Financial Reconstruction.
This I have attempted in the bill which I have already
introduced. But on the present occasion I content myself
with a substitute for the present measure. The
amendment of which I have given notice has the twofold
object of the pending bill: first, to enlarge the currency;
and, secondly, to change the existing banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
system, so as to provide practically for free banking and
to enlarge banking facilities.</p>

<p>If you will look at my amendment, you will see that
it enlarges the limit of bank-notes from $300,000,000
to $500,000,000. This is practically a provision for free
banking, at least for some years. Practically it leaves
the volume of currency to be regulated by legitimate
demand, with a proviso for the withdrawal of legal-tender
notes to an amount equal to the new issues. The
amendment then proceeds to provide bonds to be deposited
with the Government as the basis of the new banks.
And here is a just and much-needed economy,&mdash;just to
the Government, and not unjust to the banks. It is
proposed for the future to allow but four per cent. interest
on the bonds deposited by the banks. Thus far the
banks have enjoyed large benefits, and in part at the
expense of the Government. Under the operation of
my amendment these profits would be slightly reduced,
but not unduly, while the Treasury would receive an
annual benefit of not far from six million dollars in
coin. In this respect the proposition harmonizes with
the idea, which is constantly present to my mind, of diminishing
our taxes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir, in the remarks submitted by me on a former occasion
I ventured to say that the first great duty of Congress
was to mitigate the burdens now pressing upon
the energies of the people and upon the business of the
country, and, as one means of accomplishing this important
result, to extend these burdens, in a diminishing
annual ratio, over a large population entering upon the
enjoyment of the blessings which the present generation
at such enormous cost has assured to the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Upon the assumption that the national revenues and
the national expenditures would continue relatively the
same as now, a sum extending from eighty to one
hundred millions would be the measure of relief that
might be accorded at once, without arresting the continuous
reduction of the debt at the rate of $2,000,000
a month.</p>

<p>In proposing this large reduction of taxation at this
time, with the hope of larger reductions in the near
future, it was necessary to keep in view the possibility
of increased expenditure or of decreased receipts. To
guard against such contingency we must keep strict
watch over the expenditures, and, if possible, diminish
the positive annual obligations of the nation. And here
the mind is naturally and irresistibly attracted to the
prodigious item of interest. Cannot this be reduced at
an early day by a large amount, and then subsequently,
though contingently, by a much larger amount? And
should not this result be one of our first endeavors? Is
it not the first considerable stage in the reduction of
taxation?</p>

<p>The credit of the country is injured by two causes:
first, the refusal to redeem past-due obligations, being
so much <i>failed paper</i>, which condition must necessarily
continue so long as we deliberately sanction an inconvertible
currency; and, secondly, the menace of Repudiation,
with slurs upon the integrity of the people
uttered in important quarters. These two causes are
impediments to the national credit. How long shall
they continue? Loyally and emphatically has Congress
declared that all the obligations of the nation shall
be paid according to their spirit as well as letter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>But
this is not enough. More must be done. And here
Congress must act, not partially, nor timidly, nor in
the interests of the few only, but impartially, comprehensively,
firmly, and in the interests of the many. It
must help the recognized ability of the nation by removing
its disabilities.</p>

<p>Nearly five years have now passed since the Rebellion
sheathed its sword. But the national expenditures
did not cease at once when the sword no longer plied
its bloody work. They still continued, sometimes under
existing contracts which could not be broken, sometimes
in guarding the transition from war to peace.
Meanwhile the national faith was preserved, while the
people carried the unexampled burden willingly, if not
cheerfully. The large unliquidated debt, the <i>débris</i> of
the war, has been paid off or reduced to a form satisfactory
to the creditor, and the world has been assured
that the people are ready for any sacrifices according to
the exigency. Is more necessary? Should these sacrifices
be continued when the exigency has ceased?</p>

<p>These sacrifices are twofold, being direct and indirect.
The direct are measured by the known amount of
taxation. The indirect are also traced to existing taxation,
and their witnesses are crippled trade, unsettled
values, oppressive prices, and an inconvertible currency,
which of itself is a constant sacrifice. Therefore do I
say again, <i>Down with the taxes!</i></p>

<p>Bills relating to taxation do not originate in the
Senate; but Senators are not shut out from expressing
themselves freely on the proper policy which is demanded
at this time. On the finances and the banks
the Senate has the same powers as the other House.
Here it may take the initiative, as is shown by th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>e
present bill. But what it does should be equal to the
occasion; it should be large, and not petty,&mdash;far-reaching,
and not restricted in its sphere. The present bill,
I fear, has none of these qualities which we desire at
this time. It is a patch or plaster only, when we need
a comprehensive cure.</p>

<p>To my mind it is easy to see what must be done.
The country must be relieved from its heavy burdens.
Taxation must be made lighter,&mdash;also less complex
and inquisitorial. Simplification will be a form of relief.
Our banking system is ready to adapt itself to the
wants of the country, if you will only say the word.
Speak, Sir, and it will do what you desire. But instead
of this we are asked by the Committee to begin by making
the system more complex, without adding to its efficiency;
we are asked to construct a third currency,
which so long as it continues must be a stumbling-block;
we are asked to establish discord instead of concord.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, in order to bring the Senate to a precise
vote on what I regard as the fundamental proposition
of my amendment, I shall withdraw the amendment as
a whole, and move to strike out the first two sections of
the Committee’s bill, and to insert as a substitute what
I send to the Chair.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The proposed substitute, being Section 5 of Mr. Sumner’s bill, having
been read, he continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>On that proposition I have one word to say. It is
brief: that you will admit. It is simple: that you will
admit. It enlarges the existing national bank circulation
by $200,000,000: that is ample, as I believe you
will admit. Practically it is a system of free b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>anking:
that is, it is such until the enlarged circulation is absorbed,&mdash;that
is, for some time to come. But free
banking is what, as I understand, Senators desire.</p>

<p>Then, again, it has in it no element of injustice.
There is no injustice to the North or to the East. All
parts of the country are equally accommodated and
equally protected. But this cannot be said of the
pending measure.</p>

<p>Then, again, it is elastic, adapting itself everywhere
to the exigencies of the place. If banking facilities are
needed, and the capital is ready, under that amendment
they can be enjoyed. Unlike the proposition of the
Committee, it is not of cast-iron, but is so as to adapt
itself to all the conditions of business in every part of
the country.</p>

<p>Then, again, in the final provision, that for every
bank-note issued a greenback shall be withdrawn, you
find the great highway to specie payments. All your
greenbacks will speedily be withdrawn. You will have
then only the bank-notes, making one paper currency;
and then speedily, within a brief period, you will have
specie payments. The banks must have their reserves;
there will be no greenbacks for them; they must find
them in specie. The banks, then, and every stockholder,
will find a motive to press for specie payments, and
you will have that great result quietly accomplished,
absolutely without shock, while the business interests of
the country will rejoice.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 1st, in further advocacy of this amendment, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;As it is understood that the Senate
is to vote to-day on the bill and all pending propositions,
I seize this moment to say a last word for the
proposition which I have had the honor of moving, and
which is now pending. But before I proceed with the
discussion, allow me to say, that, while sitting at my
desk here, I have received expressions of opinion from
different parts of the country, one or two of which I
will read. For instance, here is a telegraphic dispatch
from a leading financial gentleman in Chicago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your views on Currency Question much approved here.
Authorize new bank circulation to extent named, retiring
greenbacks <i>pari passu</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is the very rule which I seek to establish.</p>

<p>At the same time I received a communication from
Circleville, Ohio, dated January 25th, the first sentences
of which I will read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Please pardon me for this intrusion. I desire to ask, if
you are willing to indicate, what will likely be the result of
your financial bill. I think I only utter the sentiment of
three fourths of all the commercial men through our great
and growing West, when I say it should become a law, and
thereby secure to us our equal share of the national banking
capital, which we now need so much.”</p>

</div>

<p>This, again, is what I seek to accomplish.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this stage, I hope I may have the indulgence of
the Senate, if I ask one moment’s attention to the bill
of the Committee. On a former occasion I ventured to
say that it was inadequate.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The more I reflect upon
it, the longer this debate is continued, the more I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
impressed with its inadequacy. It does not do what
should be done by the first measure of legislation on
our finances adopted by the present Congress. It is incomplete.
I wish I could stop there; but I am obliged
to go further, and say that it is not only incomplete, but
it is, in certainly one of its features, to which I shall
call attention, mischievous. I take advantage of this
moment to present this point, because it has not been
mentioned before, and because at a later stage I may
not have the opportunity of doing so. It is this provision
at the end of the first section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But a new apportionment shall be made as soon as practicable,
based upon the census of 1870.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the proper time I shall move to strike out these
words, and I will now very briefly assign my reasons.</p>

<p>The proposition is objectionable, first, because it is
mischievous,&mdash;and, secondly, because it is difficult, if
not impracticable, in its operation; and if I can have
the attention of the Senate, unless figures deceive me,
and unless facts are at fault, I think that the Senate
must agree in my conclusion.</p>

<p>We are told by the Comptroller of the Currency that
$45,000,000 is a large allowance of currency at this
moment for the South and West; indeed, I believe
he puts the limit at $40,000,000. Now suppose only
$40,000,000 are taken up during the coming year,&mdash;that
is, till the completion of the census; that would
leave $5,000,000 still outstanding, which might be employed
for the benefit of the South and West. That
circumstance indicates to a certain extent the financial
condition of those parts of the country. Do they need
larger facilities, and, if so, to what extent? Can yo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>u
determine in advance? I doubt it. But, Sir, in the
face of this uncertainty, this bill steps in and declares
positively that “a new apportionment shall be made as
soon as practicable, based upon the census of 1870.”
What will be the effect of such a new apportionment?
Even according to the census of 1860, such new apportionment
would transfer some sixty million dollars from
banks that enjoy it to other parts of the country; it
would take away from those banks what they want, and
transfer it where it is not wanted. The language is imperative.
But, Sir, it is not to be under the census of
1860, but under the census of 1870; and unless figures
deceive, by that census the empire of the great West
will be more than ever manifest. And if the transfer is
made accordingly, it will take some ninety or one hundred
million dollars from where it now is, and is needed,
and carry it to other places where certainly it will
not be needed in the same degree. What will be the
effect of such a transfer?</p>

<p>Mark, Sir, the statute is mandatory and unconditional.
There is no chance for discretion; it is to be done;
the transfer is to be made. And now what must be the
consequence? A derangement of business which it is
difficult to imagine, a contraction of currency instantaneous
and spasmodic to the amount of these large sums
that I have indicated.</p>

<p>I do not shrink from contraction. I am ready to
say to the people of Massachusetts, “If the Senate will
adopt any policy of contraction that is healthy, well-considered,
and with proper conditions, I would recommend
its acceptance.” But a contraction like that proposed
by this bill, which arbitrarily takes from North
and East this vast amount, and transfers it to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>nother
part of the country, where it may not be needed, such
a contraction I oppose as mischievous. I see no good
in it. I see a disturbance of all the channels of business;
and I see a contraction which must be itself infinitely
detrimental to the financial interests of the Republic.</p>

<p>But then, Sir, have you considered whether you can
do it? Is it practicable? I have shown that it is mischievous:
is it practicable? Can you take this large
amount of currency from one part of the country and
transfer it to another? Have you ever reflected upon
the history of the bank-note after it has commenced its
travels, when it has once left the maternal bank? It
goes you know not where. I have been informed by
bank-officers, and by those most familiar with such
things, that a bank-note, when once issued, very rarely
returns home. I have been assured that it is hardly
ever seen again. The banks, indeed, may go into liquidation,
but their notes are still current. The maternal
bank may be mouldering in the earth; but these its
children are moving about, performing the work of circulation.
Why? The credit of the nation is behind
them; and everybody knows, when he takes one of
them, that he is safe. Therefore, I ask, how can the
proposed requirement be carried into execution? how
can you bring back these runaways, when once in circulation
on their perpetual travels?</p>

<p>There is but one way, and that is by the return to
specie payments. Hold up before them coin, and they
will all come running back to the original bank; but
until then they will continue abroad. The proposed requirement
seems to go on the idea that bank-notes, like
cows, return from pasture at night; whereas w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>e all
know, that, until specie payments, they are more like
the wild cattle of the prairies and the pampas; you
cannot find them; they are everywhere. Surely I am
not wrong, when I suggest that the proposed requirement
is impracticable as well as mischievous; and at
the proper time I shall move to strike it out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The amendment which I have moved has been under
discussion for several days. It has had the valuable
support of the Senator from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Chandler</span>],
who brings to financial questions practical experience.
It has been opposed by other Senators, and with considerable
ardor by my excellent friend from Indiana
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>].</p>

<p>On Thursday last, the Senator from Indiana, addressing
himself to me, and inviting a reply, which I was
then prevented from making, took issue with me directly
upon the position I have assumed, that the withdrawal
of legal-tender notes would materially assist the
effort for specie payments; and he further declared that
the two currencies of bank-notes and United States
notes were kept together because one was redeemable
with the other. I do not quote his precise words, but I
give the substance.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Under the policy we are now pursuing, it seems to
me, that, with $356,000,000 of legal-tender notes in circulation,
the Government will not for many years, if
ever again, pay specie. With that amount of United
States notes, under the actual policy, the bank currency
will forever remain inconvertible. And the correctness
of these positions I will endeavor briefly to demonstr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>ate.</p>

<p>A convertible currency is nothing more nor less than
the servant of coin. If there is no coin, it can neither
be servant nor representative, though it may attempt to
perform the functions of coin. Presenting itself under
false pretences, it but partially succeeds in this attempt;
and the discredit attaching to it compels it to pay more
for any property than would be the price of such property
in coin, or the acknowledged representative of coin,&mdash;just
as doubtful people must submit to ten, fifteen, or
twenty per cent. discount, when what is known as “gilt-edged”
commercial paper is discounted at five, six, or
seven per cent. Thus far we have had no coin in the
Treasury appropriated to the stability of the United
States notes,&mdash;and under our present policy, dictated
by the restrictive laws that hedge the Secretary of the
Treasury and confine his liberty of action, we never
shall have, until the whole bonded debt of the country
is extinguished,&mdash;while at the same time the banks
are excused under the law from all attempts to fortify
their notes with coin.</p>

<p>And what is it that successfully discourages us from
direct steps toward specie payments?</p>

<p>In the first place, it is the mistrust of the people in
our ability to resume, and to maintain resumption. In
the next place, the monthly publication of the Treasury
discloses precisely our weakness as well as our strength;
and the great element of our weakness is the volume
of our past-due and demand obligations. In ordinary
times,&mdash;that is, when the people have confidence in the
ability of the banks to redeem their demand obligations
in coin,&mdash;a reserve of twenty to twenty-five per cent.
in coin is more than sufficient to meet any probable d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>emand
that may be made. Let mistrust arise in relation
to the solvency of any bank or of the system of banks,
and the reserve of twenty-five per cent. will vanish as
the dew before the sun, and the individual bank or all
the banks must close their doors to all demands for
specie.</p>

<p>In our present legislation we encounter this mistrust
wide-spread among the people; and so long as we ourselves
exhibit so great timidity in our attempts at legislation
upon this subject, just so long do we minister to
and strengthen this mistrust.</p>

<p>The amount of demand obligations which the Treasury
must be prepared to meet upon a moment’s notice,
including three per cent. certificates and fractional currency,
is more than four hundred and forty million dollars.
With the existing mistrust, measured by the premium
on gold, a reserve of twenty-five per cent. of coin
in the Treasury appropriated to these demands would
be totally insufficient. This reserve must bear a proportion
to the aggregate of liabilities so large as to remove
mistrust, and this can be accomplished only by
presenting as in the vaults of the Treasury an amount
of coin nearly equal to the sum of liabilities.</p>

<p>If during the last three years we had retained the surplus
of coin that has reached the Treasury, we should
now have enough; but, as a consequence of such accumulation,
speculation would have run riot,&mdash;and I fear,
if we should now by legislative enactment decree that
course for the future, we should aggravate the situation.</p>

<p>What, then, is left for us to do? What but to lessen
our liabilities?&mdash;which, as the laws now stand, must
remain the same to-morrow as to-day, and one, two, o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>r
five years hence immutably as now.</p>

<p>Difficulties beset the contraction of those liabilities,
as there are difficulties that impede the accumulation of
coin in sufficient amount to meet our purpose; but the
former may be neutralized, if not removed, by judicious
compensations that will not in any serious degree retard
the object for which I would legislate.</p>

<p>Sound financial authorities unite in declaring, that, if
the Government resumes specie payments, the banks of
New York can resume; and when the banks of New
York resume, the whole country can resume. Evidently,
then, our care is the Government.</p>

<p>And what is the first step? To my mind we must
lessen the demand obligations of the Government, while
the Secretary of the Treasury at the same time strengthens
the reserves in the national vaults. Neither should
be done suddenly or violently, but gradually, judiciously,
and wisely. As the statutes now stand, the obligations
cannot be reduced. With the present volume of
obligations, the laws of trade prevent the Secretary of
the Treasury from sufficiently strengthening his reserves.
It therefore devolves upon the National Legislature
to take the initiative in the effort to resume
specie payments.</p>

<p>The difficulties that impede the reduction of the national
liabilities lie in the fact that such obligations are
a part, and a large part, of the currency of the country.
To withdraw that currency without giving a substitute
is to create stringency, burden trade, and invite chaos:
at least, so it seems. These obligations, so far as they
relate to the currency, are larger in amount than those
of the national banks combined; and furthermore, they
are the head and front of all. They are so large as t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>o
be beyond the point of manageability, and I would
therefore reduce them within control. It is their volume
that puts them beyond control, and it is our want
of control that causes them to be depreciated. Thus,
Sir, I would offer inducements to fund them, or part
of them, in bonds that would be sought after because of
their valuable uses beyond a mere investment, and to
neutralize the evils of contraction of Treasury liabilities
by authorizing their assumption, with the consent of
the people, by various parties in different sections of the
country, each one of whom would be fully equal to the
task thus voluntarily assumed. I would issue a bank-note
for every dollar of Treasury obligation cancelled;
but I would issue no bank-note that did not absorb an
equal obligation of the Treasury. By this distribution
of a portion of the demand obligations you restore to
the Government the full ability to meet the remainder;
and at the same time the people know, that, so far as
the currency goes,&mdash;and it is of this only we are treating,&mdash;every
promise of any bank has its ultimate recourse
in the Treasury of the United States.</p>

<p>The absorption of one hundred and fifty or two hundred
millions cannot fail to enhance the remaining legal-tender
nearly, if not quite, to par with gold. The
volume of currency in the channels of trade and in the
hands of the people will be about the same as now.
The aggregate of United States notes and national bank-notes
outstanding will be precisely the same. Therefore
the indirect contraction so much dwelt upon will scarcely
be felt. The volume of greenbacks will be ample for
the reserves of the banks, and their growing scarcity
will cause them to become more and more valuable;
and as they approach the standard of gold, so wil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>l they
sustain with golden support the bank-notes into which
they are convertible.</p>

<p>The demand by the people for legal-tender will not be
appreciably increased, as the bank-note is receivable by
the Government for all dues except customs, and those
demands are necessarily localized. While the growing
scarcity of greenbacks, because of their replacement
by bank-notes fulfilling all the requirements of general
trade, will not be noticed by the people, the banks will
take heed lest they fall, and at an early day begin to
strengthen themselves. Legal-tender reserves they must
have, and, with the honest eyes of our Secretary of the
Treasury to detect any deficiency, they will begin their
strengthening policy at once. Instead of putting gold
received as interest forthwith on the market for sale,
they will put it snugly away in their vaults. The gold
which comes to them in the course of banking operations
will be added thereto; and almost imperceptibly
the country banks will arrive at the condition of the
city banks, whose reserves in coin and legal-tender notes
are now far beyond the requirements of law. In the
mean time, and without derangement of business, the
Treasury may strengthen its reserve,&mdash;while, on the
other hand, the quiet reduction of its liabilities advances
the percentage of the reserve to the whole amount
of liabilities in almost a compound ratio. With this
strengthening of the condition of the Treasury, made
manifest to all the world by its monthly publications,
the mistrust of the people will be gradually, but surely,
dissipated, and as surely be replaced by confidence
that all demand obligations will be redeemed at an early
day,&mdash;a confidence as wide-spread and deep-seated as
is that now prevailing in relation to our bonded deb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>t,
that it will be paid according to the spirit as well as
the letter of the law.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that just in proportion to the
strengthening of the legal-tender do we strengthen the
bank-note. Strike out of existence in a single day the
legal-tender notes, and I fear that the bank-note would
for a time fall in comparative value: so would everything
else. But I advocate no such violent measure.</p>

<p>The Senator from Indiana in his remarks appeared to
forget that we have in the country two or three hundred
millions of another legal-tender,&mdash;being coin, now displaced,
of which no legitimate use is made in connection
with the currency,&mdash;that should resume its proper position
in the paper circulation of the country. Here are
two or three hundred millions of money, now by force
of law demonetized, which I would have relieved of its
disabilities. I would change the relation of master it
now occupies to that of servant, where it properly belongs;
and I would inflate the currency with it to the
extent that we possess it. Inflation by coin is simply
specie payment, or very near it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have endeavored, Mr. President, thus briefly to respond
to the questions propounded to me. I do not
know that I have entered sufficiently into detail to explain
clearly my convictions as to the necessity for reducing
the volume of legal-tender obligations, and to
prove, as I desire to prove, that their gradual withdrawal
will enhance not only the value of the remainder, but
also the value of the bank-note. Both will ascend in
the scale. This enhancement of the whole paper currency
will tend to draw the coin of the country from its
seclusion. As in the early period of the war, befo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>re the
present currency was created, we were astonished at the
positive, but hidden, money resources of the people, so
will the outflow of hidden coin confound the calculations
of those who suppose that its volume is to be
measured by the amount in the Treasury and in the
New York banks.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am not alone in asking for the reformation
of our currency as the first stage of our financial
efforts. I read from the “Commercial and Financial
Chronicle”<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> of New York, an authoritative paper
on this subject, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In any practical scheme to improve the Government
finances and credit, or to restore prosperous activities, or
both at once, the first thing to be done <i>must be</i> the restoration
of a sound currency. That done or provided for, all the
rest will be easy; the best credit and the lowest rates of interest
will follow.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this end our greenbacks must be absorbed or paid,
and my proposition provides a way. As the greenbacks
are withdrawn, coin will reappear to take their place in
the banks and the business of the country. This will
be specie payments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I wish to remark that I fail to see the asserted
dependence of our demand notes on our bonds. The
bonds may be at par without bringing the notes to par,
and so the notes may be at par without bringing the
bonds to par. According to the experience of other
countries, bonds and notes do not materially affect each
other. The two travel on parallel lines without touching.
Each must be provided for; and my present purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
is to provide for the demand notes.</p>

<p>There is strong reason why this is the very moment
for this effort. According to statistical tables now before
me, our exports are tending to an equality with our
imports. During the five months of July, August, September,
October, and November, 1869, there has been a
nominal balance in our favor of $1,752,416; whereas
during the same months of last year there was an adverse
balance of $32,163,339. The movement of specie
is equally advantageous. During the five months
above mentioned there has been an import in specie of
$10,056,316 against $5,273,116 during the same months
last year, and an export in specie of $19,031,875 against
$21,599,758 during the same months last year.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> According
to these indubitable figures, the tide of specie as
well as of business is beginning to turn. It remains for
us by wise legislation to take advantage of the propitious
moment. Take the proper steps and you will have
specie payments,&mdash;having which, all the rest will follow.
Because I desire to secure this great boon for my
country I now make this effort.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was rejected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>March 2d, Mr. Sumner’s bill having been reported back from the
Committee on Finance with an amendment in the nature of a substitute,
he spoke in review of their respective provisions as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The measure now before the Senate
concerns interests vast in amount and influence. I
doubt if ever before any nation has attempted to deal at
once with so large a mass of financial obligations, being
nothing less than the whole national debt of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
States. But beyond the proper disposition of this mass
is the question of taxation, and also of the extent to
which the payment of the national debt shall be assumed
by the present generation, and beyond all is the
question of specie payments. On all these heads my
own conclusions are fixed. The mass of financial obligations
should be promptly adjusted in some new form
at smaller interest; taxes must be reduced; the payment
of the national debt must be left in part to posterity;
specie payments must be provided for.</p>

<p>The immediate question before the Senate is on a
substitute reported by the Committee for the bill which
I had the honor of introducing some weeks ago. Considering
my connection with this measure, I hope that I
shall not intrude too much, if I recur to the original bill
and explain its provisions.</p>

<p>There are certain general objects which must not be
forgotten in our present endeavor. I have already said
that the taxes must be reduced. Here I am happy to
observe that the popular branch of Congress, in the exercise
of its constitutional prerogative, has taken the initiative
and is perfecting measures to this end. I trust
that they will proceed prudently, but boldly.</p>

<p>In harmony with this effort the expenditures of the
Government should be revised and cut down to the lowest
point consistent with efficiency. Economy will be
an important ally. Even in small affairs it will be the
witness to our purposes. Through these agencies our
currency will be improved, and we shall be brought to
specie payments, while the national credit will be established.
Not at once can all this be accomplished, but I
am sure that we may now do much.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>As often as I return to this subject I am impressed
by the damage the country has already suffered through
menacing propositions affecting the national credit. I
cannot doubt that in this way the national burdens have
been sensibly increased. By counter-propositions in the
name of Congress we have attempted to counteract these
injurious influences. We have met words with words.
But this is not enough.</p>

<p>There is another remark which I wish to make, although
I do little more than repeat what I said on another
occasion.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It is that a national debt, when once
funded, does not seem to affect largely the condition of
the currency. The value of the former is maintained or
depressed by circumstances independent of the currency.
But, on the other hand, the condition of the currency
bears directly upon all efforts for increased loans; and
this is of practical importance on the present occasion.
The rules of business are the same for the nation as for
an individual; nor can a nation, when it becomes a borrower,
hope to escape the scrutiny which is applied to
an individual under similar circumstances. Applying
this scrutiny to our case, it appears that on our existing
bonded debt we have thus far performed all existing obligations,&mdash;not
without discussion, I regret to add, that
has left in some quarters a lingering doubt with regard
to the future, and not without an opposition still alive,
if not formidable. But the case is worse with regard to
that other branch of the national debt known as legal-tenders,
where we daily fail to perform existing obligations,
so that these notes are nothing more than so
much <i>failed paper</i>. With regard to this branch of the
national debt there is an open confession of insolvency,
and each day renews the confession. Now, by the immutabl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>e
laws of credit, which all legislative enactments
are impotent to counteract or expunge, the nation must
suffer when it enters the market as a borrower. Failing
to pay these obligations already due, it must pay more
for what it borrows. Nor can we hope for more than
partial success, until this dishonor is removed.</p>

<p>With these preliminary remarks, which are rather
hints than arguments, I come directly to the measure
before the Senate; and here I begin with the first section.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wish the Senate would note the difference between
this section in my bill and in the substitute of
the Committee. I proposed to authorize the issue of
$500,000,000 of Ten-Forty five per cents., and prescribe
the use to which the proceeds of such bonds should be
applied. The Committee propose $400,000,000 of Ten-Twenty
five per cents., and leave the application of the
proceeds the subject of discretion. Between the two
propositions there are several differences: first, in the
amount; secondly, in the length of the bond; and, thirdly,
in the application of the proceeds.</p>

<p>Here I beg to observe that the original sum of
$500,000,000 was not inserted by accident, or because
it was a round and euphonious sum. Nothing of the
kind. It was the result of a careful examination of the
national debt in its details, especially in the light of
the national credit. It was adopted because it was the
very sum required by the nature of the case. At least
so it seemed to me. A brief explanation will show if
I was not right.</p>

<p>The year 1862, which marks the date of our legal-tenders,
marks also the date of a new system in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to our loans. Senators are hardly aware of this change.
Previously our standard for sixes was an immutable loan
for twenty years. By the new system this immutability
was continued as to the right of demand by the bondholder,
but the right of payment was reserved to the
nation at any time after five years. This change, as
we now see, gave positive advantages to the nation.
Its disadvantages to the bondholder were so apparent
that it encountered resistance, which was overcome only
after undaunted perseverance and final appeal to the
people. Now, by recurring to the schedule of the national
debt, you will find that the first loan within the
sphere of this discretionary system is the Five-Twenties
of 1862, which, on the 1st of February last, after deducting
the purchased bonds, were $500,000,000. This,
therefore, is the first loan falling within our discretion,
the first loan we are privileged to pay before maturity,
and the first loan presenting itself for payment. In
these incidents the loan of 1862 has precedence,&mdash;it
stands first.</p>

<p>But there is a reason, which to my mind is of peculiar
force, why this first loan should be paid in coin at
the earliest possible day. It seems to me that I do
not deceive myself, when I consider it conclusive on
this question. The loan of 1862 is the specific loan
which has been made the objective point of all the
movements under the banner of Repudiation. It is
the loan to which this idea first attached itself. It is
the loan first menaced. Therefore, to my mind, it is the
loan which should be first provided for. I know no
way, short of universal specie payments, by which the
national credit can be so effectually advanced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>Why in the amendment of the Committee the amount
of the proposed issue is placed at $400,000,000 I am at
a loss to conceive. Here is no equivalent of any one
loan, nor of two or more loans. It is an accidental sum,
and might have been more or less for the same reason
that it is what it is. The term Ten-Twenties seems
also accidental, as it is unquestionably new. Of course
it is assumed that the amount proposed of Ten-Twenties
at five per cent. will absorb an equal amount of
Five-Twenties at six per cent., irrespective of any particular
loan; but I am at a loss to see on what grounds
the holders of the sixes can be induced to make the
exchange. Will the substitute bonds be considered of
equal value? I affirm not. But assuming that they
are acceptable, how shall they be acceptably distributed?
Shall the first comer be first served? If all were
at the same starting-point, the palm might be justly
bestowed upon the most swift. In the latitude allowed,
stretching over all the Five-Twenties, there would be
opportunity for favoritism; and with this opportunity
there would be temptation and suspicion.</p>

<p>The change from a Ten-Forty bond to a Ten-Twenty
bond, as proposed by the Committee, is a change, so far
as I can perceive, made up of disadvantages. To the
nation there is the same rate of interest, and there is
the same fixed period during which this interest must
be paid; while, on the other hand, the period of optional
payment is reduced from thirty years to ten years.
If there be advantage in this reduction, I do not perceive
it. If at the expiration of ten years we are in a
condition to pay, we may do so as readily under a Ten-Forty
as under the Ten-Twenty proposed. If during
the subsequent ten years of option our advancing credit
enables us to command a lower rate of interest, surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
we may do so just as favorably under one as under the
other. There is no benefit within the bounds of imagination,
so far at least as I can discern, which will not
redound to the nation from Ten-Forties as much as
from Ten-Twenties. On the other hand, it is within
possibilities, from disturbance in the money markets of
the world, or from other unforeseen circumstances, that
it may not be convenient during the short optional period
of the Committee to obtain the necessary coin without
a sacrifice. The greater latitude of payment leaves
the nation master of the situation, to pay or not to pay,
as is most for the national advantage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the loan proposed by the Committee
has not, to my mind, the elements of success promised
by the other loan. It is assumed in both cases that the
coin for the redemption of the existing obligations shall
be obtained in Europe. Then we must look to the European
market in determining the form of the new loan.
Now I have reason to believe that a coin loan to the
amount of $500,000,000 may be obtained in Europe on
Ten-Forties at par, provided the new bonds are of the
same form and purport as the Ten-Forties which are
already so popular, and provided further that the proceeds
of the loan are applied to the payment in coin at
par of the Five-Twenties of 1862. The reasons are obvious.
The Ten-Forties have a good name, which is
much to start with. It is like the credit or good-will
of an established mercantile house, which stands often
instead of capital; and then the fact that the proceeds
are to be absorbed in the redemption of the first Five-Twenties,
so often assailed, will most signally attest
the determination of the country to maintain its credit.
These advantages cost nothing, and it is difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
see why they should be renounced.</p>

<p>We must not make an effort and fail. Our course
must be guided by such prudence that success will be
at least reasonably certain. For the nation to offer a
loan and be refused in the market will not do. Here,
as elsewhere, we must organize victory. Now it is to
my mind doubtful, according to the information within
my reach, if the loan proposed by the Committee
can be negotiated successfully at par. Bankers there
may be who would gladly see themselves announced as
financial agents of the great Republic; but it remains
to be seen if there are any competent to handle a
loan of $500,000,000 who would undertake it on the
terms of the Committee. I am clear that it is not prudent
to make the experiment, when it is easy to offer
another loan with positive advantages sufficient to turn
the scale. Washington, in his Farewell Address, said,
“Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation?
Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?”
In the same spirit I would say, Why forego the advantages
of a well-known and peculiar security? Why
quit our Ten-Forties to stand upon a security which
is unknown, and practically foreign, whether at home
or abroad?</p>

<p>In the loan proposed by the original bill we find
assurance of success, with the promise of reduced taxation,
Repudiation silenced, and the coin reserves in
the banks strengthened by sales in Europe, it may be,
$150,000,000. Should the amendment of the Committee
prevail, I see small chance of any near accomplishment
of these objects, and meanwhile our financial
question is handed over to prolonged uncertainty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>I pass now to the substitute of the Committee
for the second and third sections of the original bill.
Here again the amount is changed from $500,000,000
to $400,000,000. I am not aware of any reason for
this change; nor is there, indeed, any peculiar reason,
as in the case of the Five-Twenties of 1862, for the
amount of $500,000,000. The question between the
two amounts may properly be determined by considerations
of expediency, among which will be that of uniformity
with outstanding loans. A more important
change is in the time the bonds are to run, which is
Fifteen-Thirty years for the bonds at four and a half
per cent., and Twenty-Forty years for the bonds at four
per cent. Here occurs again the argument with regard
to the inferiority of Ten-Twenties, as compared with
Ten-Forties. By the same reason the Fifteen-Thirties
will be inferior to the Fifteen-Fifties, and the Twenty-Forties
will be inferior to the Twenty-Sixties, of the
original bill.</p>

<p>The prolongation of the bond is in the nature of
compensation for the reduction of interest. Already
we have established the ratio of compensation for such
reduction,&mdash;already for a loan at six per cent. we have
offered Five-Twenties, but for a loan at five per cent. we
have offered Ten-Forties,&mdash;and I see no reason why
by a tentative process we should so materially change
this standard as is now proposed. The experiment can
do no good, while it may do harm. It is in the nature
of a restriction on our discretion, and a limitation of the
duration of the bond, which, I apprehend, must interfere
essentially with its marketable character. While
the prolongation of time enlarges the option of the nation,
it increases the value of the bond in the market.
That which is most favorable to the nation is mos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>t
favorable to the market value of the bond; and that
which is unfavorable to the nation is unfavorable also
to the market value of the bond, rendering its negotiation
and sale more difficult and protracted. Thus at
every turn are we brought back to the original proposition.</p>

<p>Against this conclusion is the argument founded on
the idea of English consols. It is sometimes said, If
the short term of Five-Twenty years is the standard for
a six per cent. bond with a graduation to Twenty-Sixty
for a four per cent. bond, why may we not go further,
and establish consols at three per cent., running, if you
please, to eternity?&mdash;The technical term “consols” is an
abbreviation for the consolidated debt of Great Britain,
and in the eyes of a British subject has its own signification.
It means a debt never to be paid, or at least it
is an inscribed debt carrying no promise of payment.
I would not have any debt of the United States assume
either the form or name of consols. I would rigidly adhere
to definite periods of payment. This is the American
system, in contradistinction to the British system.
I would not only avoid the idea that our debt is permanent,
but I would adhere to the form of positive payment
at some fixed period, and keep this idea always
present in the minds of the people. Without the requirement
of law, I doubt if the debt would be paid.
Political parties would court popularity by a reduction
of taxation. The Treasury of the United States, like
the British Treasury, would always be without a surplus,
and the national debt would be recognized as a
burden to be endured forever. Therefore do I say, <i>No
consols</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>There is another consideration, having a wide influence,
but especially important at the West and South,
which should induce us to press for a reduction of the
interest on our bonds; and here I present an argument
which, if not advanced before, is none the less applicable.</p>

<p>Do Senators consider to what extent the Government
determines the rates of interest in the money centres of
the country? Not only for itself does it determine, but
for others also. Government bonds enjoy preëminence
as an investment,&mdash;and if the interest is high, they attract
the disposable money of the country. Government
sixes are worth more than a six per cent. bond of any
private corporation or individual, no matter how well
secured. Therefore, it is easy to see, so long as we retain
our standard at six per cent., so long as we have
sixes, will the capital of the country seek these bonds
for investment, permanent or temporary, to the detriment
of numerous enterprises important to the national
development, which are driven to be the stipendiaries
of foreign capital. Railroads, especially at the West and
South, are sufferers, being sometimes delayed by the difficulty
of borrowing money, and sometimes becoming
bankrupt from ruinous rates of interest, always in competition
with the Government. But what is true of
railroads is also true of other enterprises, which are
pinched, and even killed, by these exactions in which
the Government plays such a part. All are familiar
with the recurring appeals for money on bonds even
at eight per cent., which is more than can be paid permanently
without loss; and even at such a ruinous rate
there is difficulty in obtaining the required amount.</p>

<p>Doubtless the excessive interest now demanded is
partly due to our fictitious currency, where <i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>failed</i> paper
is forced upon the market; but beyond this influence
is that of our sixes, absorbing disposable capital. I
venture to assert, that, if we could at an early day reduce
these sixes to fives, there are millions which would
be released to seek investment in other securities at six
per cent., especially to the relief of the West and South.
The reduction of interest to four and a half per cent.
and four per cent. would release further millions. A
recent incident in the financial history of Massachusetts
illustrates the disturbing influence of our sixes. An attempt
to obtain a loan in Europe at five per cent. was
unsuccessful, chiefly because the National Government
offered six per cent.</p>

<p>Therefore, for the sake of public enterprise in its
manifold forms, for the sake of that prosperity which
depends on human industry, for the sake of manufactures,
for the sake of commerce, and especially for the
sake of railroads, by which all these are quickened, we
must do what we can to reduce the general rate of interest,
which is now such a curb on enterprise; and
here we must begin with our own bonds. Without
any adverse intention, the National Government is a
victorious competitor, and the defeated parties are those
very enterprises whose success is so important to the
country. A competition so destructive should cease.
Keeping this before us in the new loan, we shall adopt
that form of bond by which the interest will most surely
be reduced. Thus, while refunding the national debt,
we shall open the way to improvements of all kinds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is what I have to say for the present on the refunding
propositions of the Committee. Their object is
the same as mine. If I differ from them in det<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>ails, it is
because after careful consideration it seems to me that
in some particulars their system may be improved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Proceeding from these pivotal propositions, I find
other things where I must again differ. When I first
addressed the Senate on this subject, I took occasion to
declare my objection to the idea of agencies or offices in
the commercial centres of Europe, where interest should
be paid. I am not ready to withdraw that objection,&mdash;though,
if I could be tempted, it would be by the Senator
from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>], when he held up the
prospect of a common money among nations. This is
one of the desires of my heart, as it is one of the necessities
of civilization; but I fail to see how this aspiration
will be promoted by the system proposed,&mdash;which
must be judged on its own merits, without any such
recommendation. It is easy to see that such a system,
besides being the beginning of a new policy on the part
of the Government, may entail serious embarrassments.
Sub-treasuries must be created in foreign capitals, which
must be continued so long as the bonds last. Remittances
of coin must be semiannual; and should such
remittances fail at any time, there must be advances at
no little cost to the Government. I cannot imagine any
advantage from this new system sufficient to induce us
to encounter the possible embarrassments or entanglements
which it may cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I would not take too much of the time of the Senate,
and therefore I pass at once to the proposition of the
Committee, being section seven, providing for the very
early payment of the national debt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. President, the payment of the national debt is an
American idea, and I would say nothing to weaken it
among the people. Whatever we owe must be paid;
but it is the part of prudence to make the payment in
such way as, while consistent with our obligations, shall
promote the national prosperity. In this spirit I approach
the proposition of the Committee, in which there
is so much of good, only to examine and measure it, in
order to ascertain its probable influence, especially on
the question of Taxation.</p>

<p>Here it must be borne in mind, that the present
measure in all its parts, so far as applicable, and especially
with its guaranties and pledges, must be taken as
the basis of our new engagements. The provision that
so much of the debt shall be paid annually will become
in a certain sense a part of the contract, although not
so expressed in the bond. Not less than $150,000,000
are set apart annually to be applied “to the payment
of the interest and to the reduction of the principal of
the public debt.” This is a large sum, and we should
consider carefully if such a guaranty or pledge has in
it the promise of financial stability. Promising too
much is sometimes as bad as promising too little. Our
promise must be according to our means prudently employed.</p>

<p>If we assume obligations so large as to bear heavily
upon the business of the country and to compel unreasonable
taxation, there will be little chance of financial
stability. They will become the object of attack, and
will enter into the conflict of parties,&mdash;and if repealed,
the national faith may be called in question. I need
not say that business must suffer. A less ambitious
effort on our part will be less obnoxious to attack,&mdash;thus
leaving the bonds to their natural position in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
money market, and strengthening all the movements of
commerce.</p>

<p>In order to determine the operation of this provision
we must look into details. I have the estimates before
me, showing our present and prospective liabilities for
interest; but I content myself with presenting compendiously
the result, in order to determine the question
of taxation. Suffice it to say, that under the operation
of the present measure there will be in 1871, after
the payment of all liabilities for interest, a surplus of
$43,000,000 to be applied to the payment of the national
debt. With each succeeding year the reduction
of interest will rapidly increase this surplus; and when
we bring into operation other provisions of the bill, and
convert $500,000,000 of sixes into a like amount of four
and a half per cents., effecting a further saving of interest,
equal to $7,500,000 annually, the surplus revenue,
as compared with necessary expenditures, will in a brief
period approach $100,000,000 annually.</p>

<p>Here the question arises, Is not this unnecessarily
large? Is it not beyond the bounds of prudence and
wise economy? Shall we declare in this fundamental
measure a determination to redeem the whole national
debt within a period of twenty-five years? Can the industries
of the country sustain such taxation? I put
the question. You shall answer it. The future has its
great claims upon us; so also has the present. I submit
that the pending measure sacrifices the present. I
conclude, therefore, as I began, with another appeal for
reduced taxation. At the proper time I shall move an
amendment, in order to aid this result.</p>

<p>In the course of the proceedings which followed, the bill of the Committee
underwent important amendments, in accordance with the views
expressed by Mr. Sumner,&mdash;for the Ten-Twenties and Fifteen-Thirties
therein proposed, a prolongation to Ten-Forties and Fifteen-Forties
being effected,&mdash;and the provision for the payment of interest at the

its more objectionable features being thus removed, he gave it a qualified

<hr class="tb" />

<p>March 10th, the question being on striking out a provision in the
bill of the Committee requiring the national banks to exchange the
bonds of the United States deposited by them as security for their
circulation for those bearing a lower rate of interest, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;There is a word which has been
introduced into this debate with which we were all very
familiar in another relation some years ago. It is the
word <i>Coercion</i>. A President of the United States announced
in most formal phrase that we could not coerce
a State; and now, borrowing a phrase from Mr.
Buchanan, we are told we cannot coerce a national
bank. Well, Sir, is the phrase applicable? If it be
applicable, then I insist that we can coerce a national
bank; but I do not admit its applicability. What I insist
on has already been so ably and clearly stated by
the Chairman of the Committee [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>] that
perhaps I need not add another word. I do not like to
occupy your time; yet I cannot forbear reminding you,
Sir, of the plenary power which Congress has reserved
over the banking system in that very Act by which it
was established.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The Senator from California [Mr. <span class="smcap">Casserly</span>] has read
to you the clause. We have been reminded to-day by
a Senator on this floor that these are formal word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>s,
words that often appear in statutes. But are they not
significant words? Have they not a meaning? Why
are they there? Because they have a meaning; because
they reserve to Congress what I call plenary power over
the whole system. That system may be readjusted,
modified, shaped anew, and the banks cannot complain.
They began their existence under that law; they knew
the conditions of their being; and they cannot now
murmur, if Congress chooses to exercise the prerogative
which it reserved at the very inception of the whole
system.</p>

<p>Sir, I approach this question, therefore, with the conviction
that the whole matter is open to our discretion.
Nobody can say safely that what is now proposed is not
within the power of Congress. Congress may do it, if
the occasion justifies, if in its discretion it thinks best
to do it. It may do it, if it thinks that the financial
policy of this country will be thereby promoted. The
banks are all parties to that policy. May not the country
turn around and ask the banks to do their part in
this great work of renovation? To a certain extent the
banks are in partnership with the Government. May
not the Government insist that they shall do their part
on this great occasion? Shall this effort of ours to readjust
our finances and to save this large interest to our
country be thwarted by a pretension on the part of the
banks that we have not the power to interfere?</p>

<p>But we are reminded that there is a difference between
power and right. How often, Sir, on other occasions,
have I so insisted in this Chamber! A great,
broad, vital distinction there always is between power
and right. A nation or an individual may have a power
without right. Now is there not here a right as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
as a power? I cannot doubt it. I cannot doubt that
Congress may rightfully exercise what I cannot doubt is
an existing power. Why should it not? It could exercise
it&mdash;who can doubt?&mdash;with reference to the public
interests, to promote the national credit. It will not
exercise it in any spirit of wantonness, in any spirit of
injustice,&mdash;but to promote the national credit. Is not
that a rightful object? No one will say the contrary.
Why, then, shall we hesitate?</p>

<p>We are reminded that these banks have secured certain
privileges, and it is said often that those are
vested, and the old phrase “vested rights” has been
repeated. But how can they have vested rights under
a statute which contains the provision just read to us,
securing to Congress full power to change it in every
respect? What, then, is the simple aspect of this question?
It is that certain securities have been lodged
with the Government by these banks on which they
transact their business, and now in readjusting the national
debt it is deemed advisable and for the public interests
that the securities should be at a lower rate of
interest than when they were originally deposited. Is
it not right for Congress to require that? I cannot see
the wrong in it. I cannot see any doubt on the question.
To my mind it is clear; it is absolutely within
the province of Congress, in the exercise of the discretion
which it originally retained over this whole subject.</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that in this debate we shall not be
pressed too much with the suggestion that we cannot
coerce these banks. If the occasion requires, and if the
term be applicable, then do I say we may coerce these
banks to the extent of obliging them to take these se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>curities
at a reduced rate of interest. I find no Repudiation
in that. I find nothing wrong in that. I find
nothing in it but a simple measure in harmony with
this great process of Financial Reconstruction in which
we are now engaged. I call it Financial Reconstruction;
and in this work ought not the banks to take
their place and perform their part?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, Sir, I have a criticism on this section. It does
not go far enough. The Committee propose that the
banks shall take one third of the three different kinds
of bonds, the five, the four and a half, and the four per
cents. I think they ought to be required to take all in
fours, and I propose to give the Senate an opportunity
of expressing its judgment on that proposition. I may
be voted down; perhaps I shall be; but I shall make
a motion, in the honest endeavor to render this bill a
practical measure, which can best succeed. I wish to
mature it; I wish to put it in the best shape possible;
and for the sake of the banks, and in the interest of the
banks, I wish such a measure as shall have a reasonable
chance of stability in the future. If you allow the
banks gains that are too large, there will necessarily be
a constant opposition, growing and developing as their
gains become more conspicuous. Why expose the system
to any such criticism? Let us now revise it carefully,
place it on sure, but moderate foundations, so that
it will have in itself the elements of future stability.</p>

<p>To my mind that is the more politic course, and I am
sure it is not unjust. You and I, Mr. President, remember
very well what was done on another occasion. The
State banks were taxed out of existence. It was the
cry, “Tax them out of existence! do not let them li<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ve!
drive them from competition with these new children of
ours, the national banks!” It was done. Was not that
coercion? If the phrase is to be employed, there was an
occasion for it. But I am not aware that it was argued,
certainly it was with no great confidence argued, that to
do that was unjust. It was a measure of policy wisely
adopted at the time, and which we all now see has answered
well. But if we could tax the State banks out
of existence, can we not, under the very specific terms
of the Act of Congress to which these national banks
owe their existence, apply a rule not unlike to them?
We do not propose to tax them out of existence, but we
propose to require that they shall lodge with the Government
securities at a lower rate of interest.</p>

<p>Something has been said, perhaps much, in this debate,
with regard to the burden that this will impose
upon the banks. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>]
has already answered that objection, and I do not
know that I can add to his answer; and yet I am not
aware that he reminded the Senate that in this very
bill there is a new and important provision in favor of
the banks, or in favor of all bondholders,&mdash;being an
exemption from all taxation, not only State and municipal,
but national.</p>

<p>There is but one other remark I will make, and that
is, we all know, unless I am much deceived, that the
banks have during these last years made great profits.
I am told that the profits of the national banks are two
or three times greater than those of the old State banks,
which we did not hesitate to tax out of existence. Now
is not that a fact in this case? Is it not an essential
element? Should it not be taken into consideration on
this occasion? If these national banks are the recipi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>ents
of such large profits, should we not exercise all the
power that belongs to us to compel them to their full
contribution to this great measure of Financial Reconstruction?
I cannot hesitate in my conclusion.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 11th, Mr. Sumner moved the addition of a section providing
for the resumption of specie payments,&mdash;being the seventh section of
the original bill,&mdash;remarking:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;Interested as I am in this bill,
desirous of its passage hardly less than the Senator
from Ohio, I am bound to say, that, in my judgment,
the passage of this single section would be worth more
than the whole bill. It would do more for the credit
of the country; it would do more for its business. It
would help us all to the completion of Financial Reconstruction.
How often have I insisted that all our efforts
to fund and refund are to a certain extent vain and impotent,
unless we begin by specie payments! That, Sir,
is the Alpha of this whole subject; and until Congress
is ready to begin with that, I fear that all the rest will
be of little avail. It is in the light of expedient rather
than of remedy. There is the remedy.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The proposition was negatived,&mdash;Congress not being yet ready for
this step.</p>

<p>In the Senate, January 20, 1870, Senator Anthony announced the
presentation by Rhode Island of a statue of Major-General Nathanael
Greene, of the Revolution, executed by the sculptor Brown, to be
placed in the old Hall of the House of Representatives. Mr. Sumner
moved its acceptance by the following Concurrent Resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">A Resolution accepting the Statue of Major-General Greene.</p>

<p><i>Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring</i>, That
the thanks of this Congress be presented to the Governor, and through him
to the people, of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, for
the statue of Major-General Greene, whose name is so honorably identified
with our Revolutionary history; that this work of art is accepted in the
name of the nation, and assigned a place in the old Hall of the House of
Representatives, already set aside by Act of Congress for the statues of eminent
citizens; and that a copy of this Resolution, signed by the President
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, be transmitted
to the Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.</p>

</div>

<p>On this he spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;How brief is life! how long is
art! Nathanael Greene died at the age of forty-four,
and now Congress receives his marble statue, destined
to endure until this Capitol crumbles to dust.
But art lends its longevity only to lives extended by
deeds. Therefore is the present an attestation of the
fame that has been won.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<p>Beyond his own deserts, Greene was fortunate during
life in the praise of Washington, who wrote of “the singular
abilities which that officer possesses,”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>&mdash;and then
again fortunate after death in the praise of Hamilton,
whose remarkable tribute is no ordinary record.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He
has been fortunate since in his biographer, whose work
promises to be classical in our literature.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> And now he
is fortunate again in a statue, which, while taking an
honorable place in American art, is the first to be received
in our Pantheon. Such are the honors of patriot
service.</p>

<p>Among the generals of the Revolution Greene was
next after Washington. His campaign at the South
showed military genius of no common order. He saved
the South. Had he lived to take part in the National
Government, his character and judgment must have
secured for him an eminent post of service. Unlike
his two great associates, Washington and Hamilton, his
life was confined to war; but the capacities he manifested
in command gave assurance that he would have
excelled in civil life. His resources in the field would
have been the same in the council chamber.</p>

<p>Of Quaker extraction, Greene was originally a Quaker.
The Quaker became a soldier and commander of armies.
Such was the requirement of the epoch. Should a soldier
and commander of armies in our day accept ideas
which enter into the life of the Quaker, the change
would only be in harmony with those principles which
must soon prevail, ordaining peace and good-will among
men. Looking at his statue, with military coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
with sword in hand, I seem to see his early garb beneath.
The Quaker general could never have been
other than the friend of peace.</p>

<p>Standing always in that beautiful Hall, the statue
will be a perpetual, though silent orator. The marble
will speak; nor is it difficult to divine the lesson it
must teach. He lived for his country, and his whole
country,&mdash;nothing less. Born in the North, he died
in the South, which he had made his home. The grateful
South honored him as the North had already done.
His life exhibits the beauty and the reward of patriotism.
How can his marble speak except for country in
all its parts and at all points of the compass? It was
for the whole country that he drew his sword of “ice-brook
temper.” So also for the whole country was the
sword drawn in these latter days. And yet there was a
difference between the two occasions easy to state.</p>

<p>Our country’s cause for which Greene contended was
National Independence. Our country’s cause recently
triumphant in bloodiest war was Liberty and Equality,
the declared heritage of all mankind. The first war was
for separation from the mother country, according to
the terms of the Declaration, “That these United Colonies
are and of right ought to be Free and Independent
States,”&mdash;the object being elevated by the great
principles announced. The second war was for the establishment
of these great principles, without which republican
government is a name and nothing more. But
both were for country. The larger masses, with the
larger scale of military operations, in the latter may
eclipse the earlier; and it is impossible not to see that
a war for Liberty and Equality, making the promises of
the Declaration a reality, and giving to mankind an ir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>resistible
example, is loftier in character than a war for
separation. If hereafter Greene finds rivals near his
statue, they will be those who represented our country’s
cause in its later peril and its larger triumph. Just in
proportion as ideas are involved is conflict elevated, especially
if those ideas concern the Equal Rights of All.</p>

<p>Greene died at the South, and nobody knows the
place of his burial. He lies without epitaph or tombstone.
To-day a grateful country writes his epitaph
and gives him a monument in the Capitol.</p>

<p>The arraignment of Mr. Sumner by Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, in

of suffrage with the whites.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Adverting to the fact that this bill was an
amendment in the nature of a substitute for one from the House, and
then reading the names of the Senators who voted for it, Mr. Trumbull
asked,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. President, do you miss the name of any Senator from that list of
Yeas?&mdash;That was the vote by which that amendment was adopted.&mdash;The
‘Absent’ were, among others, ‘Mr. Sumner.’”</p>

</div>

<p>And upon this showing, Mr. Trumbull concluded, that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Unfortunately the colored citizens of the South have nothing to thank
the Senator from Massachusetts for, in having the right of suffrage conferred
upon them.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Trumbull continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. President, this was not the only vote. A vote was taken, after
this amendment was adopted, upon the passage of the bill thus amended;
and the vote on the passage of the bill was Yeas 29, Nays 10, and among
those Yeas is not found the name of the Senator from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“But, Sir, it sometimes happens that malice and hatred will produce
results which reason and good-will can never accomplish; and when we
passed this bill giving the right of suffrage to the colored men in the South
without the aid of the Senator from Massachusetts and sent it to the President
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>] he vetoed it, and on the question of passing it over hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>s
veto the Senator from Massachusetts voted with us. His affection for the
President was not such as to allow him to coincide with him in anything.
So we got his vote at last, but we had two-thirds without him.</p>

<p>“This is the record, Mr. President.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner answered:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This assault to-day compels me to make a statement
now which I never supposed I should be called to
make. I make it now with hesitation, but rather to
show the Senator’s course than my own. Sir, I am the
author of the provision in that Act conferring suffrage;
and when I brought it forward, the Senator from Illinois
was one of my opponents,&mdash;then as now. Senators
who were here at that time remember well that this
whole subject was practically taken for the time from
the jurisdiction of the Senate into a caucus of the Republican
party, where a committee was created to whom
all pending measures of Reconstruction were referred.
I had the honor of being a member of that committee.
So was the Senator from Illinois. So was my friend
from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howard</span>]. The Senator from Ohio
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>] was our chairman. In that committee
this Reconstruction Bill was debated and matured sentence
by sentence, word for word; and then and there,
in that committee, I moved that we should require the
suffrage of all persons, without distinction of color, in
the organization of new governments, and in all the
constitutions to be made.</p>

the proposition I had made in the Senate two
years before,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> which I had urged upon the people in an

which I had again upheld in an elaborate effort
for two days in this Chamber,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and which from the beginning
I had never lost from my mind or heart. It
was natural that I should press it in committee; but
I was overruled,&mdash;the Senator opposing me with his
accustomed determination. I was voted down. The
chairman observed my discontent and said, “You can
renew your motion in caucus.” I did so, stating that I
had been voted down in committee, but that I appealed
from the committee to the caucus. My colleague [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>], who sits before me, called out, “Do so”; and
then rising, said, in language which he will pardon me
for quoting, but which will do him honor always, “The
report of the committee will leave a great question open
to debate on every square mile of the South. We must
close that question up.” Another Senator, who is not
now here,&mdash;I can therefore name him,&mdash;Mr. Gratz
Brown [of Missouri], cried out most earnestly, “Push
it to a vote; we will stand by you.” I needed no such
encouragement, for my determination was fixed. There
sat the Senator from Illinois, sullen in his accustomed
opposition. I pushed it to a vote, and it was carried by
only two majority, Senators rising to be counted. My
colleague, in his joy on the occasion, exclaimed, “This
is the greatest vote that has been taken on this continent!”
He felt, I felt, we all felt, that the question of
the suffrage was then and there secured. By that vote
the committee was directed to make it a part of Recon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>struction.
This was done, and the measure thus amended
was reported by the Senator from Ohio as chairman
of the committee.</p>

<p>I am compelled to this statement by the assault of
the Senator. I had no disposition to make it. I do
not claim anything for myself. I did nothing but my
duty. Had I done less, I should have been faithless,&mdash;I
should have been where the Senator from Illinois
placed himself.</p>

<p>The Senator read from the “Globe” the vote on the
passage of the bill, and exulted because my name was
not there. Sir, is there any Senator in this Chamber
whose name will be found oftener on the yeas and nays
than my own? Is there any Senator in this Chamber
who is away from his seat less than I am? There was
a reason for my absence on that occasion. I left this
Chamber at midnight, fatigued, not well, knowing that
the great cause was assured, notwithstanding the opposition
of the Senator from Illinois,&mdash;knowing that
at last the right of the colored people to suffrage was
recognized. I had seen it placed in the bill reported
from the committee. There it was on my motion, safe
against the assaults of the Senator from Illinois. Why
should I, fatigued, and not well, remain till morning to
swell the large and ascertained majority which it was
destined to receive?<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I have no occasion to make up
any such record. You know my fidelity to this cause.
You know if I am in the habit of avoiding the responsibilities
of my position. I cannot disguise, also, that
there was another influence on my mind. Reconstruction,
even with the suffrage, was defective. More was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
needed. There should have been a system of public
schools, greater protection to the freedmen, and more
security against the Rebels, all of which I sought in
vain to obtain in committee, and I found all effort in
the Senate foreclosed by our action in caucus. Pained
by this failure, and feeling that there was nothing more
for me to do, after midnight I withdrew. On the return
of the Act to the Senate on the veto of the President, I
recorded my vote in its favor.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>What Mr. Trumbull calls “the record” in this case, and which Mr.
Sumner, in the surprise of the occasion, seemingly accepts, according
to the obvious import of the term, as substantially the complete record,
inspection of either the Congressional Globe or the Senate Journal
shows to be very far from complete. The vote following the Presidential
veto was by no means the only one in which Mr. Sumner’s
name appears: between this and the vote which would seem from the
representation to have next preceded, designated as “the vote on the
passage of the bill,” there intervened another, involving in an important
degree the character and fate of the whole measure.</p>

<p>The bill in its original form, as it came from the House, was purely,
as indicated by its title, “a bill to provide for the more efficient government
of the insurrectionary States,” dividing them into military
districts and placing them under military rule,&mdash;this being deemed
the only effectual means of suppressing the outrages continually perpetrated
upon the loyalists of the South, black and white,&mdash;its Reconstruction
features, which included the provision for colored suffrage,
being engrafted upon it by the Senate, coupled with considerable modifications
of its military details. It was on the votes at this stage, February
16th, that Mr. Sumner’s name was wanting.</p>

<p>On the return of the bill to the House for concurrence in these
amendments, it at once encountered on the Republican side severe animadversion,
aptly expressed in the remark,&mdash;“We sent to the Senate
a proposition to meet the necessities of the hour, which was Protection
without Reconstruction, and it sends back another which is Reconstruction
without Protection.” Concurrence was refused, and a committee
of conference asked. The Senate insisting, and declining the
proposed conference, the House proceeded alone, supplementing the
Reconstruction provisions with others guarding against Rebel domi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>nation,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
and crowning their work with the emphatic vote of 128 Yeas to
46 Nays. To this vote the Senate yielded, by a concurrent vote of
Yeas 35, Nays 7,&mdash;with “the effect,” as announced, “of passing the
bill.” Mr. Sumner, hailing these amendments as what he had required,
of course voted with the Yeas,&mdash;and his name so stands on
both of the official registers, in immediate conjunction with Mr. Trumbull’s.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
This was on the 20th of February. The vote consequent upon
the Veto was ten days later, when his name was again recorded with
the Yeas.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> These two were the only votes in the Senate on the Reconstruction
Act of March 2, 1867, in the completeness of its provisions,
as it appears in the Statute-Book.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 10th, 1870, the bill for the admission of Mississippi having
come up for consideration in the Senate, Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, availed
himself of the opportunity to reopen the personal controversy with Mr.
Sumner, in an acrimonious speech denying his claim to the authorship
of the provision for colored suffrage in the Reconstruction Act of 1867,
and ascribing it to Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, a member of the other House,&mdash;quoting
Mr. Sumner’s opening declaration on this point, but resisting
the reading of what followed in explanation and support of that
declaration, under the plea that “he did not want it printed as part of
his own speech.”<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>On the conclusion of Mr. Stewart’s speech, Mr. Sumner answered as
follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;You will bear witness that I am
no volunteer now. I have been no volunteer on any
of these recurring occasions when I have been assailed
in this Chamber. I have begun no question. I began
no question with the Senator from Nevada. I began no
question with the other Senator on my right [Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span><span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>].
I began no question yesterday with the Senator
from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Conkling</span>].<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> I began no question,
either, with the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>].<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
But I am here to answer; and I begin by asking
to have read at the desk what I did say, and what
the Senator from Nevada was unwilling, as he declared,
to have incorporated in his speech. I can understand
that he was very unwilling. I send the passage to the
Chair.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The passage referred to, embracing the first three paragraphs of Mr.
Sumner’s statement in answer to Mr. Trumbull, January 21st,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> having
been read, he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>That statement is to the effect that on my motion that
important proposition was put into the bill. Does anybody
question it? Has the impeachment of the Senator
to-day impaired that statement by a hair’s-breadth?
He shows that in another part of this Capitol patriot
Representatives were striving in the same direction.
All honor to them! God forbid that I should ever
grudge to any of my associates in this great controversy
any of the fame that belongs to them! There is
enough for all, provided we have been faithful. Sir, it
is not in my nature to take from any one credit, character,
fame, to which he is justly entitled. The world
is wide enough for all. Let each enjoy what he has
earned. I ask nothing for myself. I asked nothing the
other day; what I said was only in reply to the impeachment,
the arraignment let me call it, by the Senator
from Illinois.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>I then simply said it was on my motion that this
identical requirement went into the bill. The Senator,
in reply, seeks to show that in the other Chamber
a similar proposition was brought forward; but it did
not become a part of the bill. He shows that it was
brought forward in this Chamber, but did not become a
part of the bill. It was on my motion that it did become
a part of the bill. It was not unnatural, perhaps,
that I should go further, as I did, and say that in making
this motion I only acted in harmony with my life
and best exertions for years. I have the whole record
here. Shall I open it? I hesitate. In doing so I
break a vow with myself. And yet it cannot be necessary.
You know me in this Chamber; you know how
I have devoted myself from the beginning to this idea,
how constantly I have maintained it and urged it from
the earliest date.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first stage in this series&mdash;you [Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
of Rhode Island, in the chair] remember it; you were
here; the Senator from Nevada was not here&mdash;goes to
February 11, 1862, when</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner submitted resolutions declaratory of the relations
between the United States and the territory once occupied
by certain States, and now usurped by pretended governments
without constitutional or legal right.”</p>

</div>

<p>In these resolutions it is declared, that, after an act of
secession followed by war,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The territory falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of
Congress, as other territory, and the State becomes, according
to the language of the law, <i>felo de se</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The resolutions conclude as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And that, in pursuance of this duty cast upon Congress,
and further enjoined by the Constitution, Congress will assume
complete jurisdiction of such vacated territory where
such unconstitutional and illegal things have been attempted,
and will proceed to establish therein republican forms of government
under the Constitution, and, in the execution of this
trust, will provide carefully for the protection of all the inhabitants
thereof, for the security of families, the organization
of labor, the encouragement of industry, and the welfare of
society, and will in every way discharge the duties of a just,
merciful, and paternal government.”<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir, there was the beginning of Reconstruction in this
Chamber. That was its earliest expression.</p>

<p>On the 8th of February, 1864, it appears that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner submitted resolutions defining the character
of the national contest, and protesting against any premature
restoration of Rebel States without proper guaranties and safeguards
against Slavery and for the protection of freedmen.”<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And on the same day it appears that he submitted
the following Amendment to the Constitution, which,
had it been adopted then, would have cured many of
the difficulties that have since occurred, entitled&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Amendment of the Constitution, securing Equality before
the Law and the Abolition of Slavery.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All persons are equal before the law, so that no person
can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have
power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this
declaration into effect everywhere within the United States
and the jurisdiction thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There, Sir, was the beginning of Civil-Rights Bills
and Political-Rights Bills. On the same day it appears
that Mr. Sumner introduced into the Senate “A bill to
secure equality before the law in the courts of the United
States.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The debate went on. On the 25th of February, 1865,
a resolution of the Judiciary Committee was pending,
recognizing the State Government of Louisiana. Mr.
Sumner on that day introduced resolutions thus entitled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Resolutions declaring the duty of the United States to
guaranty Republican Governments in the Rebel States on the
basis of the Declaration of Independence, so that <i>the new
governments</i>”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">that is, the reconstructed governments&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“shall be founded on the consent of the governed and the
equality of all persons before the law.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of this series of resolutions I will read two.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the path of justice is also the path of peace; and
that for the sake of peace it is better to obey the Constitution,
and, in conformity with its requirements, in the performance
of the guaranty, to reëstablish State governments
on the consent of the governed and the equality of all persons
before the law, to the end that the foundations thereof
may be permanent, and that no loyal majorities may be
again overthrown or ruled by any oligarchical class.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<p>Then comes another resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That considerations of expediency are in harmony with
the requirements of the Constitution and the dictates of justice
and reason, especially now, when colored soldiers have
shown their military value; that, as their muskets are needed
for the national defence against Rebels in the field, so are
their ballots yet more needed against the subtle enemies of
the Union at home; and that without their support at the
ballot-box the cause of Human Rights and of the Union itself
will be in constant peril.”<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the resolution reported by the Senator from Illinois
for the admission of Louisiana without Equal
Rights, I had the honor of moving the very proposition
now in question, under date of February 25, 1865:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That this shall not take effect, except upon the
fundamental condition <i>that within the State there shall be no
denial of the electoral franchise or of any other rights on account
of color or race, but all persons shall be equal before the
law</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here was the first motion in this Chamber for equality
of suffrage as a measure of Reconstruction. I entitled
it at the time “the corner-stone of Reconstruction.”
But here, Sir, it was my misfortune to encounter the
strenuous opposition of the Senator from Illinois. I
allude to this with reluctance; I have not opened this
debate; and I quote what I do now simply in reply to
the Senator from Nevada. Replying on that occasion
to the Senator from Illinois, I said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States are bound by the Constitution to
‘guaranty to every State in this Union a republican form
of government.’ Now, when called to perform this guaranty,
it is proposed to recognize an oligarchy of the skin. The
pretended State government in Louisiana is utterly indefensible,
whether you look at its origin or its character.
To describe it, I must use plain language. It is a mere
seven-months’ abortion, begotten by the bayonet in criminal
conjunction with the spirit of Caste, and born before its
time, rickety, unformed, unfinished, whose continued existence
will be a burden, a reproach, and a wrong. That is the
whole case; and yet the Senator from Illinois now presses it
upon the Senate at this moment, to the exclusion of the important
public business of the country.”<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Louisiana Bill, though pressed by the Senator
from Illinois, was defeated; and the equal rights of the
colored race were happily vindicated. His opposition
was strenuous.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I did not content myself with action in
this Chamber. Our good President was assassinated.
The Vice-President succeeded to his place. Being here
in Washington, I entered at once into relations with
him,&mdash;hoping to bring, if possible, his great influence
in favor of this measure of Reconstruction; and here is
a record, made shortly afterward, which I will read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During this period I saw the President frequently,&mdash;sometimes
at the private house he then occupied, and sometimes
at his office in the Treasury. On these occasions the
constant topic was ‘Reconstruction,’ which was considered in
every variety of aspect. More than once I ventured to press
upon him the duty and the renown of carrying out the principles
of the Declaration of Independence, and of founding
the new governments in the Rebel States on the consent of
the governed, without any distinction of color. To this earnest
appeal he replied, on one occasion, as I sat with him
alone, in words which I can never forget: ‘On this question,
Mr. Sumner, there is no difference between us: you and I
are alike.’ Need I say that I was touched to the heart by
this annunciation, which seemed to promise a victory without
a battle? Accustomed to controversy, I saw clearly, that,
if the President declared himself in favor of the Equal
Rights of All, the good cause must prevail without controversy.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then followed another incident:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On another occasion, during the same period, the case of
Tennessee was discussed. I expressed the hope most earnestly
that the President would use his influence directly for the
establishment of impartial suffrage in that State,&mdash;saying,
that, in this way, Tennessee would be put at the head of the
returning column, and be made an example,&mdash;in one word,
that all the other States would be obliged to dress on Tennessee.
The President replied, that, if he were at Nashville,
he would see that this was accomplished. I could not help
rejoining promptly, that he need not be at Nashville, for at
Washington his hand was on the long end of the lever, with
which he could easily move all Tennessee,&mdash;referring, of
course, to the powerful, but legitimate, influence which the
President might exercise in his own State by the expression
of his desires.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, as I was about to leave on my return
home to Massachusetts, in an interview with him I
ventured to express my desires and aspirations as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> follows:
this was in May, 1865:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After remarking that the Rebel region was still in military
occupation, and that it was the plain duty of the President
to use his temporary power for the establishment of
correct principles, I proceeded to say: ‘First, see to it that
no newspaper is allowed which is not thoroughly loyal and
does not speak well of the National Government and of
Equal Rights’; and here I reminded him of the saying of
the Duke of Wellington, that in a place under martial law an
unlicensed press was as impossible as on the deck of a ship
of war. ‘Secondly, let the officers that you send as military
governors or otherwise be known for their devotion to Equal
Rights, so that their names alone will be a proclamation,
while their simple presence will help educate the people’;
and here I mentioned Major-General Carl Schurz, who still
held his commission in the Army, as such a person. ‘Thirdly,
encourage the population to resume the profitable labors
of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, without delay,&mdash;but
for the present to avoid politics. Fourthly, keep the
whole Rebel region under these good influences, and at the
proper moment hand over the subject of Reconstruction,
with the great question of Equal Rights, to the judgment
of Congress, where it belongs.’ All this the President received
at the time with perfect kindness; and I mention this
with the more readiness because I remember to have seen in
the papers a very different statement.”<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Before I left Washington, and in the midst of my
interviews with the President, I was honored by a
communication from colored citizens of North Carolina,
asking my counsel with regard to their rights,
especially the right to vote. I will not read <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>their letter,&mdash;it
was published in the papers of the time, and
much commented upon,&mdash;but I will read my reply.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, May 13, 1865.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I am glad that the colored citizens of
North Carolina are ready to take part in the organization
of Government. It is unquestionably their right and
duty.</p>

<p>“I see little chance of peace or tranquillity in any Rebel
State, unless the rights of all are recognized, without distinction
of color. On this foundation we must build.</p>

<p>“The article on Reconstruction to which you call my attention
proceeds on the idea, born of Slavery, that persons
with a white skin are the only ‘citizens.’ This is a mistake.</p>

<p>“As you do me the honor to ask me the proper stand for
you to make, I have no hesitation in replying that you must
insist on all the rights and privileges of a citizen. They belong
to you; they are yours; and whoever undertakes to rob
you of them is a usurper and impostor.</p>

<p>“Of course you will take part in any primary meetings for
political organization open to citizens generally, and will not
miss any opportunity to show your loyalty and fidelity.</p>

<p>“Accept my best wishes, and believe me, Gentlemen, faithfully
yours,</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such was my earnestness in this work, that, when invited
by the municipality of Boston, where I was born
and have always lived, to address my fellow-citizens
in commemoration of the late President, I deemed it
my duty to dedicate the day mainly to a vindication
of Equal Rights as represented by him. I hold in
my hand the address on that occasion, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> I
will read one passage. This was on the 1st of June,
1865.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The argument for Colored Suffrage is overwhelming. It
springs from the necessity of the case, as well as from the
Rights of Man. This suffrage is needed for the security of
the colored people, for the stability of the local government,
and for the strength of the Union. Without it there is nothing
but insecurity for the colored people, instability for the
local government, and weakness for the Union, involving of
course the national credit.”<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was followed by a letter, dated Boston, July 8,
1865, addressed to the colored people of Savannah, who
had done me the honor of forwarding to me a petition
asking for the right to vote, with the request that I
would present it to the President. After saying, that,
had I been at Washington, I should have had great
pleasure in presenting the petition personally, but that
I was obliged to content myself with another method,
I proceeded in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me to add, that you must not be impatient. You
have borne the heavier burdens of Slavery; and as these are
now removed, believe the others surely will be also. This
enfranchised Republic, setting an example to mankind, cannot
continue to sanction an odious oligarchy whose single
distinctive element is color. I have no doubt that you will
be admitted to the privileges of citizens.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to suppose that Congress will sanction
governments in the Rebel States which are not founded on
‘the consent of the governed.’ This is the corner-stone of
republican institutions. Of course, by the ‘governed’ is
meant all the loyal citizens, without distinction of col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>or.
Anything else is mockery.</p>

<p>“Never neglect your work; but, meanwhile, prepare yourselves
for the privileges of citizens. They are yours of right,
and I do not doubt that they will be yours soon in reality.
The prejudice of Caste and a false interpretation of the Constitution
cannot prevail against justice and common sense,
both of which are on your side,&mdash;and I may add, the Constitution
also, which, when properly interpreted, is clearly on
your side.</p>

<p>“Accept my best wishes, and believe me, fellow-citizens,
faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was followed by an elaborate speech before the
Republican State Convention at Worcester, September
14, 1865, entitled “The National Security and the National
Faith: Guaranties for the National Freedman and
the National Creditor,”&mdash;where I insisted that national
peace and tranquillity could be had only from <i>impartial
suffrage</i>; and I believe that it was on this occasion that
this phrase, which has since become a formula of politics,
was first publicly employed. My language was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the national peace and tranquillity depend essentially
upon the overthrow of monopoly and tyranny, here is another
occasion for special guaranty against the whole pretension
of color. <i>No Rebel State can be readmitted with this controversy
still raging and ready to break forth.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Mark the words, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So long as it continues, the land will be barren, agriculture
and business of all kinds will be uncertain, and the country
will be handed over to a fearful struggle, with the terrors
of San Domingo to darken the prospect. In shutting out the
freedman from his equal rights at the ballot-box, you open
the doors of discontent and insurrection. Cavaignac, the
patriotic President of the French Republic, met the present
case, when, speaking for France, he said: ‘I do not believe
repose possible, either in the present or the future, except
so far as you found your political condition on universal suffrage,
loyally, sincerely, completely accepted and observed.’”<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I then proceeded,&mdash;not adopting the term “universal
suffrage,” employed by the eminent Frenchman,&mdash;as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is <i>impartial suffrage</i> that I claim, without distinction
of color, so that there shall be one equal rule for all men.
And this, too, must be placed under the safeguard of Constitutional
Law.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I followed up this effort by a communication to that
powerful and extensively circulated paper, the New
York “Independent,” under date of Boston, October
29, 1865, where I expressed myself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the sake of the whole country, which suffers from
weakness in any part,&mdash;for the sake of the States lately distracted
by war, which above all things need security and repose,&mdash;for
the sake of agriculture, which is neglected there,&mdash;for
the sake of commerce, which has fled,&mdash;for the sake
of the national creditor, whose generous trust is exposed to
repudiation,&mdash;and, finally, for the sake of reconciliation,
which can be complete only when justice prevails, we must
insist upon Equal Rights as the condition of the new order
of things.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<p>Mark, if you please, Sir, “as the condition of the new
order of things,”&mdash;or, as I called it on other occasions,
the corner-stone of Reconstruction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So long as this question remains unsettled, there can be
no true peace. Therefore I would say to the merchant who
wishes to open trade with this region, to the capitalist who
would send his money there, to the emigrant who seeks to
find a home there, Begin by assuring justice to all men. This
is the one essential condition of prosperity, of credit, and of
tranquillity. Without this, mercantile houses, banks, and
emigration societies having anything to do with this region
must all fail, or at least suffer in business and resources. To
Congress we must look as guardian, under the Constitution,
of the national safety.”<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the President adopted a policy of reaction.
I was at home in Massachusetts, and from Boston, under
date of November 12, 1865, I addressed him a telegraphic
dispatch, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">To the President of the United States, Washington.</span></p>

<p>“As a faithful friend and supporter of your administration,
I most respectfully petition you to suspend for the present
your policy towards the Rebel States. I should not present
this prayer, if I were not painfully convinced that thus far it
has failed to obtain any reasonable guaranties for that security
in the future which is essential to peace and reconciliation.
To my mind, it abandons the freedmen to the control of their
ancient masters, and leaves the national debt exposed to repudiation
by returning Rebels. The Declaration of Independence
asserts the equality of all men, and that rightful
government can be founded only on the consent of the governed.
I see small chance of peace, unless these great principles
are practically established. Without this the house will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
continue divided against itself.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>,<br />
“<i>Senator of the United States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Not content with these efforts, in an article more literary
than political in its character, which found a place
in the “Atlantic Monthly” for December, 1865, entitled,
“Clemency and Common Sense: a Curiosity of
Literature, with a Moral,” I again returned to this same
question. I will quote only a brief passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Again, we are told gravely that the national power which
decreed Emancipation cannot maintain it by assuring universal
enfranchisement, because an imperial government must be
discountenanced,&mdash;as if the whole suggestion of ‘Imperialism’
or ‘Centralism’ were not out of place, until the national
security is established, and our debts, whether to the national
freedman or the national creditor, are placed where they cannot
be repudiated. A phantom is created, and, to avoid this
phantom, we drive towards concession and compromise, as
from Charybdis to Scylla.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The session of Congress opened December 4, 1865,
and you will find that on the first day I introduced two
distinct measures of Reconstruction, with Equality before
the Law as their corner-stone. The first was a bill
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“A Bill in part execution of the guaranty of a republican form
of government in the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>“Whereas it is declared in the Constitution that the United
States shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republican
form of government; and whereas certain States have
allowed their governments to be subverted by rebell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>ion, so
that the duty is now cast upon Congress of executing this
guaranty: Now, therefore,</p>

<p>“<i>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</i>, That in all States lately declared to be
in rebellion there shall be no oligarchy invested with peculiar
privileges and powers, and there shall be no denial of rights,
civil or political, on account of race or color; but all persons
shall be equal before the law, whether in the court-room or at
the ballot-box. And this statute, made in pursuance of the
Constitution, shall be the supreme law of the land, anything
in the Constitution or laws of any such State to the contrary
notwithstanding.”<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The second was “A Bill to enforce the guaranty of a
republican form of government in certain States whose
governments have been usurped or overthrown.”<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Read
this bill, if you please, Sir. I challenge criticism of it
at this date, in the light of all our present experience.
It is in twelve sections, and you will find in it the very
proposition which is now in question,&mdash;being the requirement
of Equal Rights for All in the reconstruction
of the Rebel States.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the delegates”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">that is, the delegates to the Convention for the reëstablishment
of a State government&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“shall be elected by <i>the loyal male citizens</i> of the United
States, of the age of twenty-one years, and resident at the
time in the county, parish, or district in which they shall
offer to vote, and enrolled as aforesaid, or absent in the military
service of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p>And then the bill proceeds to provide,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> … That the Convention shall declare, on
behalf of the people of the State, their submission to the
Constitution and laws of the United States, and shall adopt
the following provisions, hereby prescribed by the United
States in the execution of the constitutional duty to guaranty
a republican form of government to every State, and
incorporate them in the Constitution of the State: that is
to say:&mdash;”</p>

</div>

<p>After one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four provisions, the section
proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Fifthly, There shall be no distinction among the inhabitants
of this State founded on race, former condition, or
color. Every such inhabitant shall be entitled to all the
privileges before the law enjoyed by the most favored class
of such inhabitants.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the section concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sixthly, These provisions shall be perpetual, not to be
abolished or changed hereafter.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor is this all. On the same day I introduced “A
Bill supplying appropriate legislation to enforce the
Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting Slavery,”<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
of which I will read the third section:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in further enforcement of the provision of the
Constitution prohibiting Slavery, and in order to remove all
relics of this wrong from the States where this constitutional
prohibition takes effect, it is hereby declared that all laws or
customs in such States, establishing any oligarchical privileges,
and any distinction of rights on account of race or
color, are hereby annulled, <i>and all persons in such States are
recognized as equal before the law</i>; and the penalties provided
in the last section are hereby made applicable to any violation
of this provision, which is made in pursuance of the
Constitution of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Still further, on the same day I introduced “Resolutions
declaratory of the duty of Congress in respect to
guaranties of the national security and the national faith
in the Rebel States.” One of these guaranties which I
proposed to establish was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The complete suppression of all oligarchical pretensions,
and the complete enfranchisement of all citizens, <i>so that there
shall be no denial of rights on account of color or race</i>; but
justice shall be impartial, and all shall be equal before the
law.”</p>

</div>

<p>I added also a provision which I was unable to carry,&mdash;it
was lost by a tie vote,&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The organization of an educational system for the equal
benefit of all, without distinction of color or race.”<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such, Sir, were the measures which I had the honor
of bringing forward at the very beginning of the session.
During the same session, in an elaborate effort
which occupied two days, February 5 and 6, 1866, and
is entitled “The Equal Rights of All: the great Guaranty
and present Necessity, for the sake of Security,
and to maintain a Republican Government,” I vindicated
the necessity of the colored suffrage in order to
obtain peace and reconciliation, and I placed it on the
foundations of Constitutional Law as well as natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
justice. Here is a passage from this speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And here, after this long review, I am brought back to
more general considerations, and end as I began, by showing
the necessity of Enfranchisement for the sake of public security
and public faith. I plead now for the ballot, as the
great guaranty, and <i>the only sufficient guaranty</i>,&mdash;being in
itself peacemaker, reconciler, schoolmaster, and protector,&mdash;to
which we are bound by every necessity and every reason;
and I speak also for the good of the States lately in rebellion,
as well as for the glory and safety of the Republic, that
it may be an example to mankind.”</p>

</div>

<p>The speech closed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Roman Cato, after declaring his belief in the immortality
of the soul, added, that, if this were an error, it was an
error he loved. And now, declaring my belief in Liberty
and Equality as the God-given birthright of all men, let me
say, in the same spirit, if this be an error, it is an error I
love,&mdash;if this be a fault, it is a fault I shall be slow to renounce,&mdash;if
this be an illusion, it is an illusion which I
pray may wrap the world in its angelic forms.”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The discussion still proceeded, and only a month later,
March 7, 1866, I made another elaborate effort with
the same object, from which I read my constant testimony:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not stop to exhibit the elective franchise as essential
to the security of the freedman, without which he will
be the prey of Slavery in some new form, and cannot rise
to the stature of manhood. In opening this debate I presented
the argument fully. Suffice it to say that Emancipation
will fail in beneficence, if you do not assure to the
former slave all the rights of the citizen. Until you do this,
your work will be only <i>half done</i>, and the freedman only
<i>half a man</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This speech closed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Recall the precious words of the early English writer,
who, describing ‘the Good Sea-Captain,’ tells us that he
‘counts the image of God nevertheless His image, cut in
ebony, as if done in ivory.’<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The good statesman must be
like the good sea-captain. His ship is the State, which he
keeps safe on its track. He, too, must see the image of God
in all his fellow-men, and, in the discharge of his responsible
duties, must set his face forever against any recognition of
inequality in human rights. Other things you may do, but
this you must not do.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I do not quote other efforts, other speeches, but pass
to the next session of Congress, when, at the beginning,
under date of December 5, 1866, I introduced resolutions
thus entitled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Resolutions declaring the true principles of Reconstruction,
the jurisdiction of Congress over the whole subject, the
illegality of existing governments in the Rebel States, and
the exclusion of such States with such illegal governments
from representation in Congress and from voting on Constitutional
Amendments.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of these resolutions the fourth is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in determining what is a republican form of government,
Congress must follow implicitly the definition supplied
by the Declaration of Independence, and, in the practical
application of this definition, it must, after excluding all
disloyal persons, take care <i>that new governments are founded
on the two fundamental truths therein contained: first, that all
men are equal in rights; and, secondly, that all just government
stands only on the consent of the governed</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the subject of Reconstruction was practically
discussed in both Houses of Congress. In this
Chamber a bill was introduced by the Senator from
Oregon [Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>], providing a military government.
In the House there was another bill, and on
that bill good Representatives&mdash;to whom be all honor!&mdash;sought
to ingraft the requirement of colored suffrage.
This effort, unhappily, did not prevail. The bill
came to this Chamber without it. In this Chamber the
same effort was made; but the bill, while it was still
immatured, passed into our caucus. The effort which
had thus far failed was then renewed by me in the committee,
where it again failed. It was then renewed by
me in the caucus, where it triumphed. This is the history
of that proposition. I claim nothing for myself.
I alluded to it the other day only in direct reply to the
arraignment of the Senator from Illinois. I allude to
it now reluctantly, and only in direct reply to the arraignment
of the Senator from Nevada. I regret to be
obliged to make any allusion to it. I think there is no
occasion for any. I have erred, perhaps, in taking so
much time in this explanation; but when the Senator,
after days and weeks of interval, came here with his
second indictment, I felt that I might without impropriety
throw myself upon the indulgence of this Chamber
to make the simple explanation that I have made.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>
<p>I have shown that as early as February 25, 1865, I
proposed in this Chamber to require the colored suffrage
as the corner-stone of Reconstruction. I have
shown that in an elaborate bill introduced December
4, 1865, being a bill of Reconstruction, I required the
very things which were afterward introduced in the
Reconstruction Act of 1867; and I have shown also
that here in this Chamber, at home among my constituents,
in direct intercourse with the President, and also
in communication with colored persons at the South,
from the beginning, I insisted upon the colored suffrage
as the essential condition of Reconstruction. It so happened
that I was a member of the committee appointed
by the caucus to consider this question, giving me the
opportunity there of moving it again; and then I had
another opportunity in the caucus of renewing the effort.
I did renew it, and, thank God, it was successful.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Bingham or Mr. Blaine, who made a kindred
effort in the House, been of our committee, and
then of our caucus, I do not doubt they would have
done the same thing. My colleague did not use too
strong language, when he said that then and there, in
that small room, in that caucus, was decided the greatest
pending question on the North American Continent.
I remember his delight, his ecstasy, at the result. I remember
other language that he employed on that occasion,
which I do not quote. I know he was elevated by
the triumph; and yet it was carried only by two votes.
There are Senators who were present at that caucus according
to whose recollection it was carried only by one
vote. The Postmaster-General, in conversing with me
on this subject lately, told me that he had often, in addressing
his constituents, alluded to this result as illustrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the importance of one vote in deciding a great
question. The Postmaster-General was in error. It
was not by one vote, but by two votes, that it was
carried.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, following with personal recollections concerning
the provision for colored suffrage in the Reconstruction Act of
1867, said it was his “impression” that the motion for its adoption
“in caucus” was made by “the Senator’s colleague [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>],”
“but undoubtedly the other Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>]
made it in committee, and advocated it,”&mdash;adding, however,
“Neither the Senator from Massachusetts nor any other Senator can
claim any great merit in voting for universal suffrage in February or
March, 1867. His record was made long before that.” In reference
to the latter Mr. Sherman remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senator from Massachusetts needs no defender of his course on the
question of universal suffrage. No man can deny that from the first, and
I think the very first, he has advocated and maintained the necessity of
giving to the colored people of the Southern States the right to vote.…
Early and late he has repeated to us the necessity of conferring suffrage
upon the colored people of the South as the basis of Reconstruction. I
think, therefore, that he is justified in stating that he was the first to propose
it in this body; and why should the Senator deem it necessary to
spend one hour of our valuable time now to prove this fact? In my judgment
it would be just as well for George Washington to defend himself
against the charge of disloyalty to the American Colonies, for whom he was
fighting, as for the honorable Senator to defend his record on this question.”</p>

</div>

<p>After further remarks by Mr. Stewart and Mr. Trumbull, of the
same character as the first, Mr. Wilson rose and addressed the Chair;
but a previous motion for adjournment being insisted upon and prevailing,
he was cut off, and the matter subsided.</p>

Hornet was purchased in this country by Cubans, was taken into the
open sea outside of the United States, and there armed and manned to
cruise against Spain, and started on her way toward the waters of Cuba
with arms and supplies for the revolutionists. Owing to the poor quality
of her coal, she was unable to pursue her voyage, and put into a port of
the United States, when she was libelled by the United States, upon the
ground that she was intended for the ‘service of the people of a certain colony
of the kingdom of Spain, to wit, the island of Cuba,’ etc. All of which

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
